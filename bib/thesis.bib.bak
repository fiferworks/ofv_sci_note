  abstract  = {Tetranychus urticae (T. urticae) Koch is a cosmopolitan, polyphagous mite which causes economic losses in both agricultural and ornamental plants. Some traits of T. urticae hamper its management, including a short life cycle, arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, its haplodiploid sex determination system, and its extraordinary ability to adapt to different hosts and environmental conditions. Currently, the use of chemical and biological control are the major control methods used against this mite. In recent years, some studies have focused on plant defence mechanisms against herbivores. Various families of plant compounds (such as flavonoids, glucosinolates, or acyl sugars) have been shown to behave as acaricides. Plants can be induced upon appropriate stimuli to increase their resistance against spider mites. This knowledge, together with the understanding of mechanisms by which T. urticae detoxifies and adapts to pesticides, may complement the control of this pest. Herein, we describe plant volatile compounds (VOCs) with repellent activity, and new findings about defence priming against spider mites, which interfere with the T. urticae performance. The use of VOCs and defence priming can be integrated into current management practices and reduce the damage caused by T. urticae in the field by implementing new, more sustainable crop management tools.},

  abstract  = {Plants respond to herbivory by mounting a defense. Some plant-eating spider mites (Tetranychus spp.) have adapted to plant defenses to maintain a high reproductive performance. From natural populations we selected three spider mite strains from two species, Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus evansi, that can suppress plant defenses, using a fourth defense-inducing strain as a benchmark, to assess to which extent these strains suppress defenses differently.
We characterized timing and magnitude of phytohormone accumulation and defense-gene expression, and determined if mites that cannot suppress defenses benefit from sharing a leaf with suppressors.
The nonsuppressor strain induced a mixture of jasmonate- (JA) and salicylate (SA)-dependent defenses. Induced defense genes separated into three groups: {\textquoteleft}early{\textquoteright} (expression peak at 1 d postinfestation (dpi)); {\textquoteleft}intermediate{\textquoteright} (4 dpi); and {\textquoteleft}late{\textquoteright}, whose expression increased until the leaf died. The T. evansi strains suppressed genes from all three groups, but the T. urticae strain only suppressed the late ones. Suppression occurred downstream of JA and SA accumulation, independently of the JA--SA antagonism, and was powerful enough to boost the reproductive performance of nonsuppressors up to 45%.
Our results show that suppressing defenses not only brings benefits but, within herbivore communities, can also generate a considerable ecological cost when promoting the population growth of a competitor.},

Mechanical inoculation of infected material in indicator plants for viruses, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Amaranthus deflexus and Chenopodium quinoa induced typical symptoms confirming the infection by Coffee ringspot virus (CoRSV). This is the first record of CoRSV in Western Bahia, indicating that this virus probably is present in all coffee plantations of the region, established in places with higher temperatures, since this is a factor considered ideal for viral multiplication.},

  abstract  = {The red palm mite, Raoiella indica Hirst, is the most invasive pest, having spread quickly to several countries. In Brazil it is already present in several regions and has a high potential for dispersion to other regions, which could severely affect the cultivation of coconuts, bananas, native and exotic palm trees, and tropical flowers, such as those of the Heliconiaceae family. Thus, we aimed to determine the regions of Brazil most prone to the occurrence of R. indica using Maxent with updated data on its occurrence and a selection of bioclimatic variables that may influence its establishment. The occurrence data used were obtained through a literature search, online databases, and surveys carried out in the field. The model indicated a high potential for the establishment of R. indica in the following locations: a large part of the State of Roraima, the eastern part of the State of Amazonas, the northern and central-western parts of the State of Par{\'{a}}, and parts of the states of Acre and Amap{\'{a}} (North Region); the coast of Brazil from Rio Grande do Norte to the states of Para{\'{i}}ba, Pernanbuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and Bahia (Northeast Region); the states of Rio de Janeiro and Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo, the far east of Minas Gerais, and almost the entire state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, except the northern part (Southeast Region); most of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul and the most southern portion of the State of Mato Grosso (Midwest Region); and the northern part of the State of Paran{\'{a}} and small parts of the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (South Region). The bioclimatic variables that most influenced the potential geographical distribution of R. indica were precipitation of driest month (Bio14), precipitation of wettest month (Bio13), mean diurnal range (Bio2), and isothermality (Bio3). The parameterization for the Maxent model provides an updated model to prevention invasion of R. indica due updated data on its occurrence used. Thus, potential geographic distribution of R. indica in Brazil should be consider from this study.},

  abstract  = {Leprosis is a serious disease of citrus caused by Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C, genus Cilevirus) whose transmission is mediated by false spider mites of the genus Brevipalpus. CiLV-C infection does not systemically spread in any of its known host plants, thus remaining restricted to local lesions around the feeding sites of viruliferous mites. To get insight into this unusual pathosystem, we evaluated the expression profiles of genes involved in defense mechanisms of Arabidopsis thaliana and Citrus sinensis upon infestation with non-viruliferous and viruliferous mites by using reverse-transcription qPCR. These results were analyzed together with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the appearance of dead cells as assessed by histochemical assays. After interaction with non-viruliferous mites, plants locally accumulated ROS and triggered the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET) pathways. ERF branch of the JA/ET pathways was highly activated. In contrast, JA pathway genes were markedly suppressed upon the CiLV-C infection mediated by viruliferous mites. Viral infection also intensified the ROS burst and cell death, and enhanced the expression of genes involved in the RNA silencing mechanism and SA pathway. After 13 days of infestation of two sets of Arabidopsis plants with non-viruliferous and viruliferous mites, the number of mites in the CiLV-C infected Arabidopsis plants was significantly higher than in those infested with the non-viruliferous ones. Oviposition of the viruliferous mites occurred preferentially in the CiLV-C infected leaves. Based on these results, we postulated the first model of plant/Brevipalpus mite/cilevirus interaction in which cells surrounding the feeding sites of viruliferous mites typify the outcome of a hypersensitive-like response, whereas viral infection induces changes in the behavior of its vector.},

  volume    = {9},
  abstract  = {False-spider mites of the genus Brevipalpus are highly polyphagous pests that attack hundreds of plant species of distinct families worldwide. Besides causing direct damage, these mites may also act as vectors of many plant viruses that threaten high-value ornamental plants like orchids and economically important crops such as citrus and coffee. To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant-mite interaction we used an RNA-Seq approach to assess the global response of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) plants along the course of the infestation with Brevipalpus yothersi, the main vector species within the genus. Mite infestation triggered a drastic transcriptome reprogramming soon at the beginning of the interaction and throughout the time course, deregulating 1755, 3069 and 2680 genes at 6 hours after infestation (hai), 2 days after infestation (dai), and 6 dai, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a clear modulation of processes related to the plant immune system. Co-expressed genes correlated with specific classes of transcription factors regulating defense pathways and developmental processes. Up-regulation of defensive responses correlated with the down-regulation of growth-related processes, suggesting the triggering of the growth-defense crosstalk to optimize plant fitness. Biological processes (BPs) enriched at all time points were markedly related to defense against herbivores and other biotic stresses involving the defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Levels of both hormones were higher in plants challenged with mites than in the non-infested ones, supporting the simultaneous induction of genes from both pathways. To further clarify the functional relevance of the plant hormonal pathways on the interaction, we evaluated the mite performance on Arabidopsis mutants impaired in SA- or JA-mediated response. Mite oviposition was lower on mutants defective in SA biosynthesis (sid2) and signaling (npr1), showing a function for SA pathway in improving the mite reproduction, an unusual mechanism compared to closely-related spider mites. Here we provide the first report on the global and dynamic plant transcriptome triggered by Brevipalpus feeding, extending our knowledge on plant-mite interaction. Furthermore, our results suggest that Brevipalpus mites manipulate the plant defensive response to render the plant more susceptible to their colonization by inducing the SA-mediated pathway.},

We describe significant findings, illuminating the scenario by providing broad insights into plant signaling involved in several arthropod-host interactions},

Molecular diagnostic tools provide valuable support for the rapid and accurate identification of morphologically indistinct alien species. However, these tools currently lack standardization. They are not conducive to adaptation by multiple sectors or countries, or to coping with changing pest priorities. The data presented here identifies DNA barcodes as a very promising opportunity to address this. DNA of tussock moth and fruit fly specimens intercepted at the New Zealand border over the last decade were reanalysed using the cox1 sequence barcode approach. Species identifications were compared with the historical dataset obtained by PCR--RFLP of nuclear rDNA. There was 90 and 96% agreement between the methods for these species, respectively. Improvements included previous tussock moth {\textquoteleft}unknowns{\textquoteright} being placed to family, genera or species and further resolution within fruit fly species complexes. The analyses highlight several advantages of DNA barcodes, especially their adaptability and predictive value. This approach is a realistic platform on which to build a much more flexible system, with the potential to be adopted globally for the rapid and accurate identification of invasive alien species.},

Despite this, there is limited information known on their basic biology, such as species status and reproductive modes, making it difficult to develop effective and sustainable control strategies. The species/strain status of Balaustium and Bryobia mites from southern Australia was examined using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. In addition, the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method was used to examine the reproductive mode and genetic diversity of Ba. medicagoense from 16 populations within southern Australia. Results indicate that there is only one species of Balaustium (Ba. medicagoense) and as many as seven species of Bryobia mites currently present in grain crops, pastures and roadsides within southern Australia. The Bryobia species complex consists of four recently described lineages (Bryobia sp. I, Bryobia sp. IV, Bryobia sp. VII, and Bryobia praetiosa Koch) and three additional genetic lineages (Bryobia sp. VIII, Bryobia sp. IX, and Bryobia sp. X) that have not been described previously. Bryobia sp. VIII, B. sp. IX, and B. sp. I seem to be the most abundant species present in Australian broadacre agriculture (i.e., land suitable for farms practicing large-scale crop [agriculture] operations). The AFLP data revealed that Ba. medicagoense reproduces asexually and that genetic diversity was low with only 10 genotypes found. These findings indicate a new complex of pest mites are present within Australian grain crops and pastures and this has implications for their control.},

On tomato plants, most genotypes of the herbivorous generalist spider mite Tetranychus urticae induce JA defenses and perform poorly on it, whereas the Solanaceae specialist Tetranychus evansi, who suppresses JA defenses, performs well on it. We asked to which extent these spider mites and the predatory mite Phytoseiulus longipes preying on these spider mites eggs are affected by induced JA-defenses. By artificially inducing the JA-response of the tomato JA-biosynthesis mutant def-1 using exogenous JA and isoleucine (Ile), we first established the relationship between endogenous JA-Ile-levels and the reproductive performance of spider mites. For both mite species we observed that they produced more eggs when levels of JA-Ile were low. Subsequently, we allowed predatory mites to prey on spider mite-eggs derived from wild-type tomato plants, def-1 and JA-Ile-treated def-1 and observed that they preferred, and consumed more, eggs produced on tomato plants with weak JA defenses. However, predatory mite oviposition was similar across treatments. Our results show that induced JA-responses negatively affect spider mite performance, but positively affect the survival of their offspring by constraining egg-predation.},

We report the synthesis of a doubly labeled JA ([1, 2-13C]JA) and use it as an internal standard to quantify by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry the changes in root and shoot JA pools in plants subjected to differing amounts of standardized leaf wounding. Wounding increased JA pools 10-fold locally in damaged leaves within 90\hspace{0.167em}min and systemically in the roots (3.5-fold) 180\hspace{0.167em}min after wounding. If JA functions as an intermediary between stimulus and response, quantitative relationships among the stimulus, JA, and the response should exist. To examine these relationships, we varied the number of punctures in four leaves and quantified both the resulting JA in damaged leaves after 90\hspace{0.167em}min and the resulting WP nicotine concentration after 5 d. We found statistically significant, positive relationships among number of leaf punctures, endogenous JA, and WP nicotine accumulation. We used two inhibitors of wound-induced nicotine production, methyl salicylate and indole-3-acetic acid, to manipulate the relationships between wound-induced changes in JA and WP nicotine accumulation. Since wounding and the response to wounding occur in widely separated tissues, we applied inhibitors to different plant parts to examine their effects on the local and systemic components of this response. In all experiments, inhibition of the wound-induced increase in leaf JA 90\hspace{0.167em}min after wounding was associated with the inhibition of the nicotine response 5 d after wounding. We conclude that wound-induced increases in leaf JA are an important component of this long-distance signal-transduction pathway.},

  abstract  = {The genetic inheritance of resistance to leprosis, the most important viral disease of citrus in Brazil, was characterized through the phenotypic assessment of 143 hybrids resulting from crosses between tangor {\textquoteleft}Murcott{\textquoteright} (Citrus sinensis $\times$ C. reticulata) and sweet orange {\textquoteleft}P{\^{e}}ra{\textquoteright} (C. sinensis), considered to be resistant and susceptible to the disease, respectively. All plants were grafted onto Rangpur lime (C. limonia) and inoculated with Citrus leprosis virus, cytoplasmic type through the infestation with viruliferous mites, Brevipalpus phoenicis. The experiments were arranged in a completely randomized block design with 10 replicates. Incidence and severity of the disease in leaves and stems as well as plant growth parameters (plant height and stem diameter) were recorded for 3 years after the infestation with the viruliferous mites. The average values of all variables were analyzed using principal component analysis, discriminant factorial analysis, estimation of the clonal repeatability coefficients, and frequency of the distributions of the average values for each measured variable. The principal component analysis resulted in the identification of at least two groups with resistance and susceptibility to leprosis, respectively. About 99% of all hybrids were correctly classified according to the discriminant factorial analysis. The broad-sense heritability coefficients for characteristics associated with incidence and severity of leprosis ranged from 0.88 to 0.96. The data suggest that the inheritance of resistance to leprosis may be controlled by only a few genes.},

  abstract  = {The negative cross-talk between induced plant defences against pathogens and arthropod herbivores is exploited by vectors of plant pathogens: a plant challenged by pathogens reduces investment in defences that would otherwise be elicited by herbivores. This negative cross-talk may also be exploited by non-vector herbivores which elicit similar anti-herbivore defences in the plant. We studied how damage by the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis and/or infection with Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) affect the performance of a non-vector arthropod: the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a parenchym feeder just like F. occidentalis. Juvenile survival of spider mites on plants inoculated with TSWV by thrips was higher than on control and on thrips-damaged plants. However, thrips damage did not reduce spider-mite survival as compared to the control, suggesting that the positive effect of TSWV on spider-mite survival is independent of anti-thrips defence. Developmental and oviposition rates were enhanced on plants inoculated with TSWV by thrips and on plants with thrips damage. Therefore, spider mites benefit from TSWV-infection of pepper plants, but also from the response of plants to thrips damage. We suggest that the positive effects of TSWV on this non-vector species cannot be explained exclusively by cross-talk between anti-herbivore and anti-pathogen plant defences.},

  abstract  = {Plants have evolved numerous defensive traits that enable them to resist herbivores. In turn, this resistance has selected for herbivores that can cope with defenses by either avoiding, resisting or suppressing them. Several species of herbivorous mites, such as the spider mites Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus evansi, were found to maximize their performance by suppressing inducible plant defenses. At first glimpse it seems obvious why such a trait will be favored by natural selection. However, defense suppression appeared to readily backfire since mites that do so also make their host plant more suitable for competitors and their offspring more attractive for natural enemies. This, together with the fact that spider mites are infamous for their ability to resist (plant) toxins directly, justifies the question as to why traits that allow mites to suppress defenses nonetheless seem to be relatively common? We argue that this trait may facilitate generalist herbivores, like T. urticae, to colonize new host species. While specific detoxification mechanisms may, on average, be suitable only on a narrow range of similar hosts, defense suppression may be more broadly effective, provided it operates by targeting conserved plant signaling components. If so, resistance and suppression may be under frequency-dependent selection and be maintained as a polymorphism in generalist mite populations. In that case, the defense suppression trait may be under rapid positive selection in subpopulations that have recently colonized a new host but may erode in relatively isolated populations in which host-specific detoxification mechanisms emerge. Although there is empirical evidence to support these scenarios, it contradicts the observation that several of the mite species found to suppress plant defenses actually are relatively specialized. We argue that in these cases buffering traits may enable such mites to mitigate the negative side effects of suppression in natural communities and thus shield this trait from natural selection.},

  abstract  = {Microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) are molecular signatures typical of whole classes of microbes, and their recognition plays a key role in innate immunity. Endogenous elicitors are similarly recognized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This review focuses on the diversity of MAMPs/DAMPs and on progress to identify the corresponding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in plants. The two best-characterized MAMP/PRR pairs, flagellin/FLS2 and EF-Tu/EFR, are discussed in detail and put into a phylogenetic perspective. Both FLS2 and EFR are leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs). Upon treatment with flagellin, FLS2 forms a heteromeric complex with BAK1, an LRR-RK that also acts as coreceptor for the brassinolide receptor BRI1. The importance of MAMP/PRR signaling for plant immunity is highlighted by the finding that plant pathogens use effectors to inhibit PRR complexes or downstream signaling events. Current evidence indicates that MAMPs, DAMPs, and effectors are all perceived as danger signals and induce a stereotypic defense response.},

  abstract  = {Many plant species are known to emit herbivore-induced volatiles in response to herbivory. The spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch is a generalist that can feed on several hundreds of host plant species. Volatiles emitted by T. urticae-infested plants of 11 species were compared: soybean (Glycine max), golden chain (Laburnum anagyroides), black locust (Robinia pseudo-acacia), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), eggplant (Solanum melalonga), thorn apple (Datura stramonium), sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum), hop (Humulus lupulus), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba). The degree to which the plant species produced novel compounds was analyzed when compared to the odors of mechanically damaged leaves. Almost all of the investigated plant species produced novel compounds that dominated the volatile blend, such as methyl salicylate, terpenes, oximes, and nitriles. Only spider mite-infested eggplant and tobacco emitted a blend that was merely quantitatively different from the blend emitted by mechanically damaged or clean leaves. We hypothesized that plant species with a low degree of direct defense would produce more novel compounds. However, although plant species with a low direct defense level do use indirect defense to defend themselves, they do not always emit novel compounds. Plant species with a high level of direct defense seem to invest in the production of novel compounds. When plant species of the Fabaceae were compared to plant species of the Solanaceae, qualitative differences in spider mite-induced volatile blends seemed to be more prominent in the Fabaceae than in the Solanaceae.},

This report expands the range of stimuli triggering PR protein synthesis and confirms that these proteins are markers of the hypersensitive response of plants. Simultaneously, chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase activities are induced during the development of A. cladophthirus-induced lesions. This suggests that some PR proteins of S. dulcamara have chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase activities. These enzymes may contribute to the defense responses of plants against mites.},

  abstract  = {{Eriophyoidea} is a well-known mite taxon of economic importance. Due to their small size, elucidating many of
their bio-ecological aspects becomes a challenge. These mites are obligatory plant feeders, with high host
specificity and vagrant (free living) and non-vagrant (part or whole life cycle in a host) lifestyles. The mobility
(distance walked - mm, resting time - s, and number of stops) of these mites on host and non-host plant species
has been investigated. Eriophyoid species were submitted to walking tests on host and non-host plants using five
vagrant species and five non-vagrant species. The walking was recorded with video tracking (ViewPoint) for
ten minutes. Twenty replicates were performed for each treatment (eriophyoid species and plant). There was a
difference in the behavioral response of the species studied in relation to the hosts. When the species were
grouped by ecological lifestyle (vagrant and non-vagrant), non-vagrant eriophyoids presented a higher mobility
(higher distance walked, less resting time) than vagrant eriophyoids on their respective hosts. There was no
difference in the mobility of vagrant and non-vagrant species on non-host plants. The absence of a pattern of
behavioral response among the species tested here indicates that more factors are involved in the host
identification and acceptance process},
  comment   = {They tried to see some indication of host specificity by observing the walking distances of both vagrant and non-vagrant mites, hypothesizing that there would be a difference for mites which were not on their host plant.

This work aimed to determine the potential areas for establishment of both mites and viruses in Mexico, based on the geographical distribution of the hosts and the climatic suitability for the vectors. Life tables of both mites were constructed to determine their thermal requirements---base temperature and degree-days required to complete life cycle---and population growth parameters---net reproduction rate, generation time, and intrinsic growth rate. For this, the mites were confined in Citrus aurantium fruits at 20, 22.5, 25 or 30 {$^{\circ}$}C, 60\hspace{0.167em}$\pm$\hspace{0.167em}5% RH and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Maps were generated where the climatic suitability for establishment of the mites and the citrus leprosis viruses was estimated in citrus-producing municipalities. The climatic suitability was determined through historical temperature records to calculate the potential number of generations per year, and ecological niche modeling based on collecting localities and bioclimatic variables using the algorithm Maxent. The base temperature was 9.5 {$^{\circ}$}C for B. californicus and 10.2 {$^{\circ}$}C for B. yothersi; degree-days required to reach adulthood were 372.1 and 331.7 {$^{\circ}$}C, respectively. Potential sites for establishment of B. yothersi are mostly lowlands, whereas for B. californicus they are both lowlands and highlands. Temperature data indicate that B. californicus has fewer sites where it can develop >\hspace{0.167em}16 generations per year than B. yothersi. According to our results, the sites where citrus leprosis is most likely to present high incidence are the sweet orange cultivars bordering the Gulf of Mexico.},
  comment   = {Research Q: Which areas in Mexico have the greatest risk for the establishment of Brevipalpus californicus and B. yothersi, the vectors of citrus leprosis diseases, OFV and CiLV, respectively?
Motivation: To protect agriculture from invasive mite spp. and their diseases (epidemics)
Results: Models predict that B. cali and C. yothersi will do well in the same places, citrus-growing regions. B. yothersi populations grow faster reached population, 5x that of B. californicus in 65  days:  predicted 16 generations per year in best locales. Establishment model: "There are two areas with the highest concentration of cultivated citruses; one is located in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico coast (areas in orange and red) and covers part of the states of Veracruz, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le{\'{o}}n, where sweet citrus trees such as orange and mandarin predominate; the other is located in the central part of the Pacific coast and covers mainly the states of Michoac{\'{a}}n and Colima, where Mexican lemon plantations predominate." Risk models: "The area where high host densities and favorable climate conditions coincide corresponds to the state of Michoac{\'{a}}n, where both mites could complete more than 16 generations per year. In the northern coastal area of the Gulf of Mexico, where the largest sweet orange cultivated area is found in the country, both species could complete between 12 and 16 generations per year. However, in wide areas of the Yucatan Peninsula, lowlands of the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coasts, as well as lands in southern Mexico with an altitude of less than 1000 m asl, known as the Balsas Depression or Tierra Caliente, B. yothersi can reach more than 16 generations per year, whereas B. californicus can only reach more than 16 generations per year in much smaller areas in the same states. For the same climate in sites with presence of cultivated citrus crops, B. yothersi seems to be more apt to increase its populations than B. californicus."
Methods: Life tables, then establishment model, then ecological niche modelling. See paper for specifics, pretty complicated sounding models.
Conclusions: Most citrus growing regions at risk for establishment of these mites, and therefore at risk for citrus leprosis, protection methods should be focused in the specific regions with high risk.
Impressions: Cryptic spp. make this model overestimate, also: humans primary source of infestation is assumed, not backed by data (although pretty apparent). Could have guessed that vector can exist where plant can grow, but validation is nice. (Although, done in greenhouse, so again probably an overestimate)},

  abstract  = {The objective of this study was to determine whether differences in hairiness of tomato plants affect the functional and numerical response of the predator Neoseiulus californicus McGregor attacking the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Two tomato hybrids with different density of glandular hairs were used. The functional response was measured by offering eggs and adults of T. urticae at densities ranging from 4 to 64 items per tomato leaflet (surface ca. 6.3 cm2); eggs were offered to predator protonymphs and deutonymphs, adult spider mites to adult predators. The number of spider mites eaten as a function of initial density was fitted to the disc equation. Predator densities were regressed against initial prey densities to analyze the numerical response. The number of eggs and adults of T. urticae eaten by N. californicus was extremely low in both hybrids. The nymphal stage of N. californicus and prey density had a significant effect on the number of T. urticae eggs eaten by the predator, while hybrid had no effect. The functional response fitted reasonably well to the Holling model. The handling time (T h) and the attack rate (a) were very similar among the two hybrids. The numerical response indicated that the absolute density of predators increased with changes in spider mite densities but the relative predator/prey density decreased in both hybrids. Tomato hairiness prevented N. californicus from exhibiting a strong numerical response and the predator functional response was much lower than observed in other host plants and other phytoseiids. This result shows the need to consider plant attributes as an essential and interactive component of biological control practices.},

  abstract  = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a modern powerful technique that can be used for studying the external
and internal anatomy of arthropods. CLSM has seldom been used in acarology and very rarely for studying eriophyoid
mites. It allows the capture of precise digital images of the fine details of external and internal chitinous structures, which
can be further analysed using various computer programs. CLSM can serve as an effective tool for comparing closely
related and/or cryptic species, correcting diagnoses of poorly described taxa, studying immature instars, and particularly,
for studying the structures and the functioning of the internal genitalia of adult females and males. In this paper, the
potential use of CLSM for the study of eriophyoids is demonstrated using specimens of 13 mite species and eight genera
from the families Phytoptidae Murray 1877 and Eriophyidae Nalepa 1898. This study showed that freshly mounted
specimens on microscope slides appeared to be the most appropriate for CLSM as older specimens tended to have reduced
autofluorescence. The best choice for studying the external morphology and internal genital apparatus of eriophyoid mites
appeared to be the blue laser. Green and light blue wavelengths (488 nm and 532 nm) were found to be less useful. The
quality of CLSM images depended on the slide-mounting medium used. Among those compared, Hoyer{\textquoteright}s medium was
found to be the most appropriate whereas Heinze medium and media including Iodium gave poorer results. The empodia
and proximal parts of setae were shown to have very weak autofluorescence signals, but they reflected red (635 nm) and
blue (405 nm) laser light, which could be detected with CLSM.},

  abstract  = {For some time, a limited number of species within the superfamily Eriophyoidea have been the only known acari involved in vectoring viruses to plants (Keifer, 1952; Slykhuis, 1963; Walkey, 1991; Oldfield and Proeseler, 1996). More recently, other acarine families have been incriminated as vectors of plant viruses including Brevipalpus species within the Tenuipalpidae and Petrobia latens (Muller) in the Tetranychidae. The spider mite vectors Barley yellow streak mosaic virus (Robertson, 1987; Robertson and Carroll, 1988; Brunt et al., 1996). This is the only documented instance of a spider mite species involved in the transmission of a viral pathogen. Species within the genus Brevipalpus are considered to be the most important economic pests within the family Tenuipalpidae, especially B. californiens (Banks), B. obovatus Donnadieu and B. phoenicis (Geijskes). All three of these species have been incriminated as vectors of at least one unassigned rhabdovirus. The recent establishment of citrus leprosis virus in Panama and its possible spread to other countries within Central America have increased awareness of the potential threat to citrus in North America and elsewhere in the world. Our limited understanding of Brevipalpus mite vectors, their biologies, feeding damage and virus movement within the mite vectors exacerbate the development of effective control strategies for citrus leprosis. These factors and an increasing list of other unassigned rhabdoviruses that are vectored by Brevipalpus mites has led to the preparation of this special issue to provide a concise update on their status. In the opening paper, Childers, French and Rodrigues provide a review of the biology, feeding injury and economic importance of four Brevipalpus species on selected plants of horticultural importance. Extensive color photographs are provided to clearly illustrate the types of feeding injury associated with these mites. The second paper by Childers, Rodrigues and Welbourn reports on the extensive host plant lists of B. califomicus, B. obovatus, and B. phoenicis. Host plants are reported for seven categories that include: each mite species alone, each two species combination of mites, and host plants that are reportedly shared by all three Brevipalpus species. Welbourn, Ochoa, Kane, and Erbe provide a taxonomic review of the genus Brevipalpus with emphasis on B. phoenicis. The taxonomic characters currently used to separate these three species are included and supported with scanning electron micrographs to facilitate character recognition. The extensive host ranges and variation in taxonomic characters within populations of B. californiens and B. phoenicis raise concerns about possible hidden species complexes occurring within these two species.  Kitajima, Chagas, and Rodrigues provide a review of Brevipalpustransmitted unassigned rhabdoviruses and virus-like diseases. The unassigned rhabdoviruses are classified as either the cytoplasmic type or the nuclear type of virus. Transmission electron microscopy provides clear examples of both types of viruses. In addition, various associated disease symptoms are provided in both black and white and color plates. Rodrigues, Kitajima, Childers, and Chagas present a review of citrus leprosis virus that is vectored by B. phoenicis on citrus varieties in Brazil. Color plates are provided to clearly illustrate symptomatic differences among various sweet orange varieties on the leaves, twigs and fruit. This is the most serious viral disease vectored by Brevipalpus mites and a color plate shows the cumulative differences between an acaricide-treated sweet orange tree and an untreated sweet orange tree left unprotected against citrus leprosis after only two seasons of growth. Childers, Rodrigues, Derrick, Achor, French, Welbourn, Ochoa, and Kitajima report on the past and present status of citrus leprosis in Florida and Texas. Evidence is provided that strongly suggests that citrus leprosis once occurred in Florida counties and then disappeared. Results of an extensive survey of sweet orange trees across Florida counties that once reported the disease have failed to located disease symptoms during 2001 and 2002. Brevipalpus feeding injuries to both sweet orange and grapefruit in Texas are reported. Citrus leprosis does not result in symptom expression on fruit, leaves or twigs of grapefruit varieties. Chagas, Kitajima, and Rodrigues report on the transmission of coffee ringspot virus by B. phoenicis in Brazil. This disease was not an economic problem initially, however, that changed in recent years with evidence of increasing damage to coffee by the disease. Kondo, Maeda, and Tamada report on orchid fleck virus and its vector, B. californicus and the final paper by Kitajima, Rezende, and Rodrigues provides a review of research conducted on Passion fruit green spot that is vectored by B. phoenicis in Brazil.  Some plant feeding insects and mites are effective vectors of plant viruses, in part, because of their high rates of reproduction, dispersal abilities, and obligate use of specific plants as food (Gilbertson et al., 1998). One example is citrus leprosis that is an unassigned rhabdovirus. The virus is not known to exist in citrus within the United States including Hawaii, Europe, South Africa, Australia or different areas within Asia. However, the potential mite vectors in the genus Brevipalpus occur in those countries. Risk for establishment of the virus into one or more of these citrus growing areas must be considered with increasing international movement of people and commodities. In addition, other related and unassigned rhabdoviruses are vectored by Brevipalpus species to coffee, passion fruit, orchids and a wide array of woody ornamentals that are reported in this special issue. The accompanying papers describe the current understanding of the biology, host plants, and distribution of Brevipalpus species as well as their feeding damage and disease symptoms on fruits, leaves and twigs of affected plants.},

  abstract  = {According to published reports from 1906 to 1968, leprosis nearly destroyed the Florida citrus industry prior to 1925. This was supported with photographs showing typical leprosis symptoms on citrus leaves, fruit, and twigs. Support for the past occurrence of citrus leprosis in Florida includes: (1) presence of twig lesions in affected orange blocks in addition to lesions on fruits and leaves and corresponding absence of similar lesions on grapefruit; (2) yield reduction and die-back on infected trees; and (3) spread of the disease between 1906 and 1925. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination of tissue samples from leprosis-like injuries to orange and grapefruit leaves from Florida in 1997, and fruits from grapefruit and sweet orange varieties from Texas in 1999 and 2000 did not contain leprosis-like viral particles or viroplasm inclusions. In contrast, leprosis viroplasm inclusions were readily identified by TEM within green non-senescent tissues surrounding leprosis lesions in two of every three orange leaf samples and half of the fruit samples obtained from Piracicaba, Brazil. Symptoms of leprosis were not seen in any of the 24,555 orange trees examined across Florida during 2001 and 2002. The authors conclude that citrus leprosis no longer exists in Florida nor occurs in Texas citrus based on: (1) lack of leprosis symptoms on leaves, fruit, and twigs of sweet orange citrus varieties surveyed in Florida; (2) failure to find virus particles or viroplasm inclusion bodies in suspect samples from both Florida and Texas examined by TEM; (3) absence of documented reports by others on the presence of characteristic leprosis symptoms in Florida; (4) lack of its documented occurrence in dooryard trees or abandoned or minimal pesticide citrus orchard sites in Florida. In view of the serious threat to citrus in the U.S., every effort must be taken to quarantine the importation of both citrus and woody ornamental plants that serve as hosts for Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), B. californicus (Banks), and B. obovatus Donnadieu (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) from countries where citrus leprosis occurs.},

The primary immune response is referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and has evolved to recognize common features of microbial pathogens. In the coevolution of host-microbe interactions, pathogens acquired the ability to deliver effector proteins to the plant cell to suppress PTI, allowing pathogen growth and disease. In response to the delivery of pathogen effector proteins, plants acquired surveillance proteins (R proteins) to either directly or indirectly monitor the presence of the pathogen effector proteins. In this review, taking an evolutionary perspective, we highlight important discoveries over the last decade about the plant immune response.},

Our goal was to evaluate the degree to which intraguild predation of A. swirskii by O. insidiosus could affect suppression of F. occidentalis. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine: (1) effects of prey densities, prey composition, and crop structure on predation by O. insidiosus, (2) prey switching by O. insidiosus, and (3) effects of Orius gender on prey preference. If relative densities of F. occidentalis and A. swirskii were varied on flowers or foliage, O. insidiosus always switched to the more abundant prey. Male and female O. insidiosus did not show preference for A. swirskii over immature or adult F. occidentalis, but females killed more prey than males. In greenhouse trials simulating thrips infestations of cut rose crops during commercial production, we compared control of F. occidentalis on roses with releases of only A. swirskii or both O. insidiosus and A. swirskii. Roses with or without predators produced similar numbers of harvestable flowers, but roses without predators had, on average, two to three times more thrips than roses with predators. Concurrent releases of O. insidiosus with A. swirskii did not appear to either interfere with or enhance suppression of F. occidentalis on cut roses because counts of thrips and predatory mites on flowers with both O. insidiosus and A. swirskii were not statistically different from similar counts on flowers with only A. swirskii.},

Plants not only possess direct chemical and morphological defenses against herbivores but also benefit from indirect defenses provided by parasitoids and predators, which use herbivores as hosts or prey. Plants play an active role in the interplay between entomophagous arthropods and herbivores and actually mediate many of the interactions, thereby influencing the intensity of protection received. Herein, we review how plant attributes influence natural enemy efficiency by providing shelter, mediating host/prey accessibility, providing host/prey finding cues, influencing host/prey suitability, mediating host/prey availability, and providing supplemental food sources for natural enemies. In light of this crucial role, we suggest ways of manipulating morphological and chemical attributes of crop plants for a more sustainable and balanced control of insect pests in agro-ecosystems.},

  abstract  = {Recognition of pathogen-derived molecules by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a common feature of both animal and plant innate immune systems. In plants, PRR signalling is initiated at the cell surface by kinase complexes, resulting in the activation of immune responses that ward off microorganisms. However, the activation and amplitude of innate immune responses must be tightly controlled. In this Review, we summarize our knowledge of the early signalling events that follow PRR activation and describe the mechanisms that fine-tune immune signalling to maintain immune homeostasis. We also illustrate the mechanisms used by pathogens to inhibit innate immune signalling and discuss how the innate ability of plant cells to monitor the integrity of key immune components can lead to autoimmune phenotypes following genetic or pathogen-induced perturbations of these components.},
  comment   = {Plants rely on a cell-autonomous innate immune system to detect the presence of microorganisms and activate immune responses that deter infection. Recognition of conserved microbial features occurs essentially at the cell surface by means of transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).

PRRs are part of multimeric protein complexes at the plasma membrane, differentially recruiting cytoplasmic kinases that connect PRR complexes to downstream signalling components.

Ligand binding initiates a series of phosphorylation events within PRR complexes that activates cellular immune signalling, which includes bursts of intracellular reactive oxygen species and calcium, activation of cytoplasmic kinase cascades, and transcriptional reprogramming.

As in mammals, excessive activation of plant immune responses can have detrimental consequences. Thus, a complex negative regulatory system controls different immune components to maintain cellular homeostasis.

Bacterial pathogens are able to subvert the plant immune system by secreting molecules, such as effectors, that often mimic the mode-of-action of host negative regulators of immune signalling.},

However, successful gene editing or genetic transformation has not yet been reported for chelicerates, the second largest group of terrestrial animals. Within this group, some mite and tick species are economically very important for agriculture and human health, and the availability of a gene-editing tool would be a significant advancement for the field. Here, we report on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. The ovary of virgin adult females was injected with a mix of Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting the phytoene desaturase gene. Natural mutants of this laterally transferred gene have previously shown an easy-to-score albino phenotype. Albino sons of injected virgin females were mated with wild-type females, and two independent transformed lines where created and further characterized. Albinism inherited as a recessive monogenic trait. Sequencing of the complete target-gene of both lines revealed two different lesions at expected locations near the PAM site in the target-gene. Both lines did not genetically complement each other in dedicated crosses, nor when crossed to a reference albino strain with a known genetic defect in the same gene. In conclusion, two independent mutagenesis events were induced in the spider mite T. urticae using CRISPR-Cas9, hereby providing proof-of-concept that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to create gene knockouts in mites.},

Not much was known about the biology, geographic origins, or evolutionary history of the genus when R. indica emerged as a major invasive pest. This paper attempts to address some of the basic historical questions regarding the palm mite as well as the genus. Molecular characters from COI and 28S regions were used to produce a phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus in an effort to understand its geographic origin. It also uses COI barcode data to delimit several potentially new species discovered by the authors in Australia. Results show a basal split between R. indica and all other Raoiella species, which indicates Africa or the Middle East as the most probable origin of the genus. Additionally, COI data suggests that at least eight new species are represented among the 20 Australian populations included in this study.},

  abstract = {Recent empirical evidence suggests that many plants respond to herbivore damage by producing inducible defenses. Although several workers have suggested that inducible defenses may be responsible for fluctuations in some herbivore populations, little formal justification for this suggestion exists. We describe here a quantitative framework that may be used for understanding the effects of inducible plant defenses on herbivore populations. In particular, we use procedures for modeling continuous, structured populations to examine the dynamics of interactions between inducible defenses and mobile herbivores. Our models indicate that inducible defenses can by themselves regulate herbivore populations under a wide variety of conditions and that, in conjunction with other regulatory agents (e.g., predators, parasitoids), they can significantly depress herbivore populations. However, only under unusual conditions can inducible defenses cause persistent fluctuations in herbivore populations. Finally, our model suggests that herbivores cannot maintain heterogeneity in the level of inducible defenses within a plant population. These conclusions may not apply to sedentary or selective herbivores or to herbivores with discrete, nonoverlapping generations.},

  abstract  = {The vigorous production of oxygenated fatty acids (oxylipins) is a characteristic response to pathogenesis and herbivory, and is often accompanied by the substantial release of small and reactive lipid-fragmentation products. Some oxylipins, most notably those of the jasmonate family, have key roles as potent regulators. Recent advances have been made in understanding oxylipin-regulated signal transduction in response to attack. Much jasmonate signaling takes place via a genetically defined signal network that is linked to the ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid signal pathways, but a second aspect of jasmonate signaling is emerging. Some jasmonates and several newly discovered cyclopentenone lipids can activate or repress gene expression through the activities of a conserved electrophilic atom group.},

  abstract  = {The strawberry is susceptible to several pests which cause a reduction in productivity. The use of mechanisms which repel or prevent these pests to establish, represent a sustainable environmental technology to reduce the frequency of agrochemical use. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of salicylic acid (SA) on resistance induction against two-spotted spider mite in strawberry cultivars (Aromas and Sweet Charlie). Five concentrations of SA (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg L-1) were tested in order to verify the antixenosis effects. In SA concentration of 50 mg L-1, a reduced number of mites in the two strawberry cultivars was noticed. For the number of eggs deposited on leaflet, we verified an effect of SA concentration with quadratic adjustment in the equation. Sweet Charlie cultivar was more effective than Aromas in relation to the reduction of mite oviposition on leaflets treated with SA. SA concentrations of 25, 50 and 75 mg L-1 were the most efficient for the evaluated traits allowed to infer its potential as antixenotic resistance inducer against two-spotted spider mite in strawberry crop.},

  abstract  = {The red palm mite, Raoiella indica (Acari: Tenuipalpidae), is a serious pest of coconut plantations in tropical countries such as Brazil. Ecologically-sound control strategies have been sought for this pest; however, the potential of entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) in controlling this pest, as well as its compatibility with co-occurring natural enemies, remains poorly investigated. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the potential of four B. bassiana strains in controlling R. indica, as well as the compatibility of the most pathogenic fungal strain with the predatory mites Amblyseius largoensis and Typhlodromus ornatus (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Briefly, the pathogenicity of four B. bassiana strains (Bb-032, Bb-053, Bb-057 and Bb-086), isolated from coconut pests, were tested against R. indica. The B. bassiana strain Bb-032 was selected for further bioassays for being the most pathogenic to R. indica. The red palm mite survival and mean survival time drastically decreased when exposed to B. bassiana strain Bb-032 at both LC50 and LC80. In contrast, neither survival nor mean survival time of A. largoensis and T. ornatus were affected by the exposure to LC50 and LC80 of B. bassiana strain Bb-032. The fungal strain showed considerable selectivity to the two predatory mites; however, at its estimated LC80 for R. indica, reduced oviposition, egg viability and the instantaneous rate of increase (ri) were generally observed for both natural enemies. Therefore, B. bassiana holds potential promise for controlling R. indica in addition to being generally selective to non-target predatory mites.},

This study evaluates the effect of synthetic MeSA lures (PredaLure) on arthropod populations during the 2009 and 2010 seasons in two Oregon vineyards (Dayton and Salem). MeSA lures were deployed at a low (4/plot or 260 lures/ha) and high (8/plot or 520 lures/ha) rate in $\sim$152 m2 plots while control plots contained no lure. The predatory mite Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten is considered to be a key biological control agent of the grapevine rust mite, Calepitrimerus vitis Nalepa in Oregon vineyards. Leaf samples were collected to assess T. pyri, C. vitis, spider mite (Tetranychidae) and thrips (Thripidae) population densities in MeSA treated plots compared to control plots. Yellow sticky traps were used to monitor other key predator groups including Anthocoridae, Araneae, Coccinellidae and Syrphidae. Our data did not display consistent trends in T. pyri response to MeSA between treatments at the two field sites over two seasons. Mean seasonal coccinellid counts were significantly higher in MeSA treatments in both years at Dayton. No differences in C. vitis population densities were found between treatments in both years. In 2009 at Salem, significantly lower pest thrips densities occurred in low rate MeSA treatments in the latter part of the season although no trend of decreased seasonal abundance was evident.},

Within the genus Dichorhavirus, CiLV-N is a recently described and distinct species present in Brazil and transmitted by B. phoenicis sensu stricto, whereas the species found in Mexico and Colombia are strains of Orchid fleck virus (OFV-citrus), suspected to be vectored by B. californicus. A study was conducted to determine whether B. californicus and B. yothersi can acquire and inoculate Mexican isolates of CiLV-C and OFV-citrus to sweet and acid citrus species (sweet orange, mandarin, grapefruit, sour orange, Persian lime and Mexican lime) in experiments set up in areas in Mexico with prevalence of the respective viruses. Brevipalpus californicus acquired OFV-citrus and transmitted it to all the citrus cultivars included in the experiment, while B. yothersi acquired CiLV-C and transmitted it only to sweet citrus cultivars (sweet orange, mandarin, and grapefruit). Both mite species were able to become established and reproduce in the experimental plants for nearly a year. This study represents the first experimental evidence of OFV-citrus transmission by B. californicus, as well as evidence that B. yothersi cannot transmit this virus.},

The biology of these plant feeding mites is reviewed, including reproductive modes, dispersal and low chromosome number. The interactions of the false spider mites with their host plants and the damage they incur are considered, including the increasing economic importance of Brevipalpus spp. and of Raoiella indica Hirst. The associations of tenuipalpids with plant diseases, caused by bacteria, fungi and especially viruses, are discussed. Methods to reduce tenuipalpid damage are reviewed, including sampling and monitoring in the field, quarantine efforts and horticultural, chemical and biological control means. Lists of natural enemies are appended, and the scarcity of specific natural enemies of the Tenuipalpidae is noted. The postulated modes that these mites employ to elude their predators are discussed. Finally, suggestions for further research are outlined. These include exploration for false spider mites and their natural enemies in relatively little-surveyed regions, studies on the biology of additional pest species and on their toxins, studying the interactions between mites, hosts and plant diseases, and the various modes of sex determination and parthenogenesis in false spider mites, with emphasis on Brevipalpus spp. and their cryptic, possibly host-associated biotypes.},

This paper highlights the poor esteem in which taxonomy, as autonomous science, is held and the relative implications of this for conservation biology.

2.
In recent times, taxonomy at the species level has tended to be neglected not just within ecological researches, but also in the identification and justification for the selection of the marine protected areas (MPA). A traditional criterion for choosing an MPA is the conservation of biodiversity, but most of the Italian MPA were chosen without initial detailed studies on their biodiversity, so that lists of species of the main invertebrate groups are not available.

3.
The identification of organisms within communities to species level is one of the greatest constraints in terms of time and costs in ecological studies. Some studies have suggested that working at a taxonomic level higher than species does not result in an important loss of information (Taxonomic sufficiency). It does, however, lead to an inaccuracy of biodiversity evaluation which is, especially important when comparing different areas, and can lead to an {\textquoteleft}a priori{\textquoteright} exclusion of some entities before understanding their role in ecology.

4.
Taxonomy has always been considered a marginal science even during the pioneer descriptive period of ecology, and traditionally has received little financial support. The result was the production of many misidentifications and erroneous records. During recent years, the developing experimental ecological approach has led to an improvement in scientific methods, but concurrently to a reduction in the number of expert taxonomists for many invertebrate groups. Descriptive works, historically so common in the Mediterranean area, are now considered obsolete, despite having an intrinsic value.

5.
Biodiversity, particularly {\textquoteleft}species richness{\textquoteright} has long been thought to influence temporal variability and it seems that efforts to clarify the biodiversity/temporal variability relationship or to demonstrate the lack of such a relationship should continue. Such information is essential in order to maintain the ecological function despite the loss of component species, an important topic not only to ecologists but also to policy makers. Many species appear to have overlapping niches, and as such it could be argued that it is not essential for all species to be present. In contrast the crucial role of keystone species has been embraced in conservation biology as a tool to help highlight species requiring priority for protection.

6.
Present knowledge of marine systems has led to the conclusion that, before developing theories and experimental design, we need an appropriate description of the system under investigation. A basic knowledge of the general biodiversity in term of species richness of a proposed MPA for example is essential, with a detailed survey providing the taxonomic lists necessary for biotope characterization and a reference data set for future comparisons.},

Since this seminal work, arachnid relationships have been evaluated using morphological characters of extant and fossil taxa as well as multiple generations of molecular sequence data. While nearly all datasets agree on the monophyly of Tetrapulmonata, and modern analyses of molecules and novel morphological and genomic data support Arachnopulmonata (a sister group relationship of Scorpiones to Tetrapulmonata), the relationships of the apulmonate arachnid orders remain largely unresolved. Three threads may allow us to resolve the recalcitrant phylogeny of arachnids: the careful evaluation of large amounts of molecular data; novel techniques grounded in comparative morphology and evolutionary developmental biology, which add improved homology statements and explain the transition between character states; and new fossil discoveries, which continue to incorporate relevant novel data to the discussion of the relationships among the arachnid orders.},

In contrast, necrotrophic pathogens benefit from host cell death, so they are not limited by cell death and salicylic acid--dependent defenses, but rather by a different set of defense responses activated by jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling. This review summarizes results from Arabidopsis-pathogen systems regarding the contributions of various defense responses to resistance to several biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. While the model above seems generally correct, there are exceptions and additional complexities.},

  abstract  = {Carnivorous arthropods exhibit complex intraspecific and interspecific behaviour among themselves when they share the same niche or habitat and food resources. They should simultaneously search for adequate food for themselves and their offspring and in the meantime avoid becoming food for other organisms. This behaviour is of great ecological interest in conditions of low prey availability. We examined by means of an olfactometer, how volatile chemicals from prey patches with conspecific or heterospecific predators might contribute to shaping the structure of predator guilds. To test this, we used the exotic predatory mites Typhlodromalus manihoti and T. aripo, and the native predatory mite Euseius fustis, with Mononychellus tanajoa as the common prey species for the three predatory mite species. We used as odour sources M. tanajoa-infested cassava leaves or apices with or without predators. T. manihoti avoided patches inhabited by the heterospecifics T. aripo and E. fustis or by conspecifics when tested against a patch without predators. Similarly, both T. aripo and E. fustis females avoided patches with con- or heterospecifics when tested against a patch without predators. When one patch contained T. aripo and the other T. manihoti, females of the latter preferred the patch with T. aripo. Thus, T. manihoti is able to discriminate between odours from patches with con- and heterospecifics. Our results show that the three predatory mite species are able to assess prey patch profitability using volatiles. Under natural conditions, particularly when their food sources are scarce, the three predatory mite species might be involved in interspecific and/or intraspecific interactions that can substantially affect population dynamics of the predators and their prey.},

  abstract  = {Herbivorous spider mites occurring on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cope with plant defences in various manners: the invasive Tetranychus evansi reduces defences below constitutive levels, whereas several strains of T. urticae induce such defences and others suppress them. In the Mediterranean region, these two species co-occur on tomato plants with T. ludeni, another closely related spider mite species. Unravelling how this third mite species affects plant defences is thus fundamental to understanding the outcome of herbivore interactions in this system. To test the effect of T. ludeni on tomato plant defences, we measured (1) the activity of proteinase inhibitors, indicating the induction of plant defences, in those plants, and (2) mite performance on plants previously infested with each mite species. We show that the performance of T. evansi and T. ludeni on plants previously infested with T. ludeni or T. evansi was better than on clean plants, indicating that these two mite species down-regulate plant defences. We also show that plants attacked by these mite species had lower activity of proteinase inhibitors than clean plants, whereas herbivory by T. urticae increased the activity of these proteins and resulted in reduced spider mite performance. This study thus shows that the property of down-regulation of plant defences below constitutive levels also occurs in T. ludeni.},

While N. glutinosa is very susceptible to Cercospora nicotianae, Chalara elegans and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae, the hybrid is as resistant as N. debneyi to these fungi. The resistance of the hybrid is linked to high levels of chitinase, $\beta$-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase (PO) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO). The parental species contain much lower levels of these enzymes unless they are locally infected with necrotizing viruses. In those cases, chitinase, $\beta$-1,3-glucanase and PO, but not PPO, increase in the whole plant to levels comparable with those found in the hybrid, and resistance to secondary infection develops (systemic acquired resistance). All the acidic isoenzymes of PO present in both parental species after infection are constitutively expressed in the hybrid. The activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was similar in all plants. These results reinforce the hypothesis that hydrolases and PO are involved in resistance against various pathogens.},

By definition, invertebrates also are wildlife. Yet, inclusion of invertebrates in peer-reviewed wildlife journals has not been investigated. As such, our objective was to assess inclusion of invertebrates in prominent wildlife journals published in the last decade. Based on our review and first-hand experience, we also aimed to provide recommendations for integration of invertebrates into wildlife science, education, and peer-reviewed literature. We performed a systematic literature review by manually searching all issues and articles from 2003--2013 of the following journals: European Journal of Wildlife Research, Journal of Wildlife Management, South African Journal of Wildlife Research, Wildlife Biology, Wildlife Research, and Wildlife Society Bulletin. We analyzed data derived from our review to elucidate trends in the inclusion of invertebrates in these journals. We identified 4,916 articles that involved animal taxa, of which 122 (2.5%) included invertebrates and 1% included invertebrates as focal taxa. Our results indicated invertebrates are included in a minute portion of articles in top wildlife journals. We recommend a paradigm shift to a less taxonomically homogenized and vertebrate-centric approach to wildlife science and education, integrating invertebrates into wildlife studies, and publishing results of those studies in wildlife journals to facilitate effective management of all wildlife species. {\copyright} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Most of these bacteria are Wolbachia, but recently a new bacterium, named Cardinium, was discovered that is capable of the same manipulations. In the host species Brevipalpus phoenicis (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) this bacterium induces thelytoky by feminizing unfertilized haploid eggs. The related species B. obovatus and B. californicus are thelytokous too, suggesting that they reproduce in the same remarkable way as B. phoenicis. Here we investigated the mode of thelytokous reproduction in these three species. Isofemale lines were created of all three species and 19 lines were selected based on variation in mitochondrial COI sequences. All B. phoenicis and B. californicus lines (10 and 4 lines, respectively) produced males under laboratory conditions up to 6.7%. In contrast, males were absent from all B. obovatus lines (5 lines). Additional experiments with two B. phoenicis isofemale lines showed that males can be produced by very young females only, while older females produce daughters exclusively. For most lines it was shown that they are indeed feminized by a bacterium as treatment with antibiotics resulted in increased numbers of males up to 13.5%. Amplification and identification of specific gyrB sequences confirmed that those lines were infected with Cardinium. Three out of the five B. obovatus lines did not produce males after treatments with antibiotics, nor did they contain Cardinium or any other bacterium that might induce thelytoky. In these lines thelytoky is probably a genetic property of the mite itself. Despite the different causes of thelytoky, flow cytometry revealed that all 19 lines were haploid. Finally, the taxonomic inferences based on the mitochondrial COI sequences were incongruent with the classical taxonomy based on morphology, suggesting that a taxonomic revision of this group is necessary.},

However, a number of asexual species are very successful and appear to contradict this general view. One such species is the phytophagous mite Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), a species that is found in a wide range of environments. There are two general explanations for this pattern, the General Purpose Genotype (GPG) and Frozen Niche Variation (FNV). According to the GPG model, an asexual species consists of clones that can all survive and reproduce in all the different niches. Alternatively, the FNV model postulates that different clones are specialized to different niches. We have performed a test to distinguish between these models in B. phoenicis. Mites from three populations from three different host plant species (citrus, hibiscus and acerola) were transplanted to their own and the two alternative host plants and mite survival and egg production were measured. Additionally, the mite populations were genotyped using microsatellites. Fitness was seriously reduced when mites were transplanted to the alternative host plant species, except when the alternative host was acerola. We concluded that B. phoenicis clones are specialized to different niches and thus the FNV best describes the broad ecological niche of this species but that there is also some evidence for host plant generalization. This conclusion was strengthened by the observations that on each host plant species the native mite population performed better than the introduced ones, and that three microsatellite markers showed that the mite populations are genetically distinct.},

  abstract  = {The attraction of natural enemies of herbivores by volatile organic compounds as an induced indirect defence has been studied in several plant systems. The evidence for their defensive function originates mainly from laboratory studies with trained parasitoids and predators; the defensive function of these emissions for plants in natural settings has been rarely demonstrated. In native populations and laboratory Y-tube choice experiments with transgenic Nicotiana attenuata plants unable to release particular volatiles, we demonstrate that predatory bugs use terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) to locate their prey on herbivore-attacked plants. By attracting predators with volatile signals, this native plant reduces its herbivore load -- demonstrating the defensive function of herbivore-induced volatile emissions. However, plants producing GLVs are also damaged more by flea beetles. The implications of these conflicting ecological effects for the evolution of induced volatile emissions and for the development of sustainable agricultural practices are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Leprosis refers to two diseases of citrus that present similar necrotic local lesions, often surrounded by chlorotic haloes on citrus. Two distinct viruses are associated with this disease, one that produces particles primarily in the nucleus of infected plant cells (Citrus leprosis virus nuclear type [CiLV-N]; Dichorhavirus) and another type that produces particles in the cytoplasm of infected plant cells (Citrus leprosis virus cytoplasmic type [CiLV-C]; Cilevirus). Both forms are transmitted by Brevipalpid mites and have bipartite, single-stranded, RNA genomes. CiLV-C and CiLV-N are present in South and Central America and as far north as parts of Mexico. Although leprosis disease was originally described from Florida, it disappeared from there in the 1960s. The United States Department of Agriculture--Agricultural Research Service maintains preserved citrus specimens identified at inspection stations 50 or more years ago with symptoms of citrus leprosis. We isolated RNA from these samples and performed degradome sequencing. We obtained nearly full-length genome sequences of both a typical CiLV-C isolate intercepted from Argentina in 1967 and a distinct CiLV-N isolate obtained in Florida in 1948. The latter is a novel form of CiLV-N, not known to exist anywhere in the world today. We have also documented the previously unreported presence of CiLV-N in Mexico in the mid-20\textsuperscript{th} century.},

Combined tactics of pest management have special significance not only for a reduction in pesticide residues but also to maintain the natural enemy activity, which is an objective of IPM programs. Here, we investigated the effect of low-lethal concentrations of bifenazate at LC10, LC20, and LC30 on development and reproduction parameters of Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot ({Acari}: {Phytoseiidae}). Lethal and sub-lethal concentrations were estimated using leaf dip bioassay method. The crude data were analyzed based on age-stage, two-sex life table analysis. Toxicological assays showed bifenazate treatments gradually decreased the longevity and total life span of both sexes. Our results indicated that reproductive and total fecundity of the next generation were also affected by sublethal concentrations. All concentrations caused a significant decline in oviposition days, compared to the control. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) varied from 0.1344 to 0.1151 day-1 for the mites treated with distilled water and LC30 treatments, respectively. The finite rate of increase ($\lambda$) was affected by the Acaricide concentration (lowest at LC30 concentration: 1.1221 day-1). Bifenazate concentration (LC10, LC20 and LC30) treatments gradually reduced the gross reproduction rate (GRR) and net reproductive rate (R0). Based on obtained results from current study, bifenazate is not a favorable Acaricide with A. swiriskii and cannot be recommended to use with this predatory mite in integrated management.},

  abstract  = {In ecology, a hypothesis is usually not discarded if a few studies reject it, as long as there are other studies supporting it. How to assess the usefulness of ecological hypotheses is therefore not straightforward. Using the enemy release hypothesis as an example, we show how creating a hierarchy of hypotheses (HoH) can help reviewing and evaluating evidence for and against an ecological hypothesis. In a HoH, a broad, overarching hypothesis branches into more specific and better testable sub-hypotheses. The enemy release hypothesis is a major hypothesis in invasion ecology and posits that the absence of enemies in the exotic range of an alien species is a cause of its invasion success. Based on a systematic review of empirical tests of this hypothesis, we divided it into sub-hypotheses, differentiating among 1) indicators for enemy release, 2) types of comparisons, and 3) types of enemies. We identified 176 empirical tests and weighted each test according to the number of alien species studied and the research method (experimental vs observational, field vs enclosure vs laboratory). For the broadly formulated enemy release hypothesis, we found nearly as much supporting (36%) as questioning evidence (43%). At the sub-hypotheses level, however, we found that some sub-hypotheses are strongly supported by empirical evidence, whereas others receive hardly any support. These differences are further emphasized for some types of habitat and focal taxonomic groups. Our findings suggest that several specific formulations (i.e. sub-hypotheses) of the broad enemy release hypothesis are useful, whereas other formulations should be viewed more critically. In general, the approach outlined here can help evaluate major ecological hypotheses and their specific sub-hypotheses. Our study also highlights the need for a scientific debate on how much supporting evidence is sufficient to consider an ecological hypothesis to be useful.},

  abstract  = {Herbivorous insects use diverse feeding strategies to obtain nutrients from their host plants. Rather than acting as passive victims in these interactions, plants respond to herbivory with the production of toxins and defensive proteins that target physiological processes in the insect. Herbivore-challenged plants also emit volatiles that attract insect predators and bolster resistance to future threats. This highly dynamic form of immunity is initiated by the recognition of insect oral secretions and signals from injured plant cells. These initial cues are transmitted within the plant by signal transduction pathways that include calcium ion fluxes, phosphorylation cascades, and, in particular, the jasmonate pathway, which plays a central and conserved role in promoting resistance to a broad spectrum of insects. A detailed understanding of plant immunity to arthropod herbivores will provide new insights into basic mechanisms of chemical communication and plant-animal coevolution and may also facilitate new approaches to crop protection and improvement.},

We measured recovery of predators on lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus L.) that were infested with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Factors thought to affect movement and colonization were distance to a receiver unit from a release (landing) point, intervening soil surfaces such as clods, gravel, fine soil and grass, and management of soil surfaces such as mulching, watering or both. In the field, the effect of distance (0.11--1.76\hspace{0.167em}m) from a landing point to a receiver unit was significant, with a negative log-linear relationship. Soil surfaces such as clods and management actions such as watering with mulching allowed for more capture of predators on bean plants with prey than did other treatments. Environmental conditions greatly affected survival of N. fallacis.Predators in the field that were present on bare soil suffered high mortality (ca. 90%) at fluctuating daytime conditions of 26.4\hspace{0.167em}$\pm$\hspace{0.167em}4.8{$^{\circ}$}C and 56\hspace{0.167em}$\pm$\hspace{0.167em}13.4% RH.

  abstract  = {Plants are hotbeds for parasites such as arthropod herbivores, which acquire nutrients and energy from their hosts in order to grow and reproduce. Hence plants are selected to evolve resistance, which in turn selects for herbivores that can cope with this resistance. To preserve their fitness when attacked by herbivores, plants can employ complex strategies that include reallocation of resources and the production of defensive metabolites and structures. Plant defences can be either prefabricated or be produced only upon attack. Those that are ready-made are referred to as constitutive defences. Some constitutive defences are operational at any time while others require activation. Defences produced only when herbivores are present are referred to as induced defences. These can be established via de novo biosynthesis of defensive substances or via modifications of prefabricated substances and consequently these are active only when needed. Inducibility of defence may serve to save energy and to prevent self-intoxication but also implies that there is a delay in these defences becoming operational. Induced defences can be characterized by alterations in plant morphology and molecular chemistry and are associated with a decrease in herbivore performance. These alterations are set in motion by signals generated by herbivores. Finally, a subset of induced metabolites are released into the air as volatiles and function as a beacon for foraging natural enemies searching for prey, and this is referred to as induced indirect defence.

Scope The objective of this review is to evaluate (1) which strategies plants have evolved to cope with herbivores and (2) which traits herbivores have evolved that enable them to counter these defences. The primary focus is on the induction and suppression of plant defences and the review outlines how the palette of traits that determine induction/suppression of, and resistance/susceptibility of herbivores to, plant defences can give rise to exploitative competition and facilitation within ecological communities {\textquotedblleft}inhabiting{\textquotedblright} a plant.

Conclusions Herbivores have evolved diverse strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, to decrease the negative effects of plant defences in order to maximize the conversion of plant material into offspring. Numerous adaptations have been found in herbivores, enabling them to dismantle or bypass defensive barriers, to avoid tissues with relatively high levels of defensive chemicals or to metabolize these chemicals once ingested. In addition, some herbivores interfere with the onset or completion of induced plant defences, resulting in the plant{\textquoteright}s resistance being partly or fully suppressed. The ability to suppress induced plant defences appears to occur across plant parasites from different kingdoms, including herbivorous arthropods, and there is remarkable diversity in suppression mechanisms. Suppression may strongly affect the structure of the food web, because the ability to suppress the activation of defences of a communal host may facilitate competitors, whereas the ability of a herbivore to cope with activated plant defences will not. Further characterization of the mechanisms and traits that give rise to suppression of plant defences will enable us to determine their role in shaping direct and indirect interactions in food webs and the extent to which these determine the coexistence and persistence of species.},

  abstract  = {Plants and herbivores are thought to be engaged in a coevolutionary arms race: rising frequencies of plants with anti-herbivore defences exert pressure on herbivores to resist or circumvent these defences and vice versa. Owing to its frequency-dependent character, the arms race hypothesis predicts that herbivores exhibit genetic variation for traits that determine how they deal with the defences of a given host plant phenotype. Here, we show the existence of distinct variation within a single herbivore species, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, in traits that lead to resistance or susceptibility to jasmonate (JA)-dependent defences of a host plant but also in traits responsible for induction or repression of JA defences. We characterized three distinct lines of T. urticae that differentially induced JA-related defence genes and metabolites while feeding on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). These lines were also differently affected by induced JA defences. The first line, which induced JA-dependent tomato defences, was susceptible to those defences; the second line also induced JA defences but was resistant to them; and the third, although susceptible to JA defences, repressed induction. We hypothesize that such intraspecific variation is common among herbivores living in environments with a diversity of plants that impose diverse selection pressure.},

We quantified volatile emissions fromNicotiana attenuata plants growing in natural populations during attack by three species of leaf-feeding herbivores and mimicked the release of five commonly emitted volatiles individually. Three compounds (cis-3-hexen-1-ol, linalool, and cis-$\alpha$-bergamotene) increased egg predation rates by a generalist predator; linalool and the complete blend decreased lepidopteran oviposition rates. As a consequence, a plant could reduce the number of herbivores by more than 90% by releasing volatiles. These results confirm that indirect defenses can operate in nature.},

  abstract  = {The erineum strain of Colomerus vitis (GEM) is the most destructive pest of vineyards in western Iran and sometimes causes considerable damages to the grapevine. Little information is available on the susceptibility of the grapevine to this pest and its knowledge can be useful for a sustainable management of GEM. The present study was aimed at evaluating the responses of the plants to the infestation of GEM in order to compare the resistance/susceptibility of some native cultivars to this pest. Also, the profiling of JA, SA and IAA in leaves of infested plants of Sezdang was studied. The experiment was carried out on eighteen native cultivars and the non-native Muscat Gordo which were selected amongst the most common in southern and western Iran. Potted plants were cultivated under greenhouse conditions at a temperature of 32 $\pm$ 3.8{$^{\circ}$}C, 75 $\pm$ 5% R.H. and a photoperiod of L16: D8 h. The impact of GEM was evaluated on the basis of the leaf area and weight, number and size of the erinea, and percentage of leaves with erinea three months after the infestation. The cane length was measured, too. Mite density on galled leaves (three months after the infestation) and in buds (at the bud breaking) was assessed.

        Cluster analysis based on the leaf damage index induced by GEM allowed to distinguish highly affected (Sezdang, Khalili, Ghalati and Rishbaba), moderately affected (Neyshaboori, Gazne, Muscat, Lale, Shahani Sefid, Ahmad, Monagha and Sia) and scarcely affected (Yaghuti, Rotabi, White Thompson, Atabaki, Koladari and Sahebi and Shahani Gerd) cultivars. The mite density into the buds and on the galled leaves was higher in the medium-late (Rishbaba and Khalili) and late ripening (Sezdang and Ghalati) cultivars rather than in the early (Sahebi and Shahani Gerd) and early-medium (Atabaki) ripening ones. The leaf damaged area, the leaf weight, the shoot length and the erineum development were correlated to the mite density and were the highest on Sezdang, Khalili, Ghalati and Rishbaba and the lowest on Atabaki, Koladari, Sahebi and Shahani Gerd. The highest density of the overwintering population was detected in proximal buds of all treated cultivars.

        The plant responses and the mite density were investigated also in the second and third year after the first mite infestation on highly affected (Sezdang, Khalili, Ghalati, Rishbaba), a few of the moderately affected (Neyshaboori, Gazne, Muscat) and the scarcely affected cultivars (White Thompson, Atabaki, Koladari, Sahebi, Shahani Gerd). The leaf damaged area, the percentage of galled leaves, the percentage of cane length reduction and the mite density strongly decreased during all three years of observations on the highly affected Sezdang, Khalili and Gazne. On the contrary, Ghalati and Rishbaba displayed an increase of the leaf damaged area, leaf damaged index and mite density on galled leaves during the same period in comparison to the first year of observation. The percentage of the leaves with erinea, the leaf damaged area and the mite density of Sezdang were highly and positively correlated with IAA while a negative correlation was found between the leaf damaged area and the mite density with SA and JA in the assayed years. Almost all data currently collected allowed a recognition of White Thompson, Atabaki, Koladari, Sahebi and Shahani Gerd as the least affected cultivars.},

  abstract  = {The third edition of A Manual of Acarology has been a long time coming and took 10 years to produce! The second edition was published in 1978, but the third edition just arrived after 10 years of labor by the authors. Contributing authors include Valerie Behan-Pelletier, David R. Cook, Mark S. Harvey, James E. Keirans, Gerald W. Krantz, Evert E. Lindquist, Roy A. Norton, Barry M. O'Connor, Ian M. Smith, and David E. Walter. In the Preface, the editors acknowledge the extensive assistance of Marilyn Houck during 1999--2003 in the planning and preparation of this edition.

Earlier editions of this book have long been a mainstay in acarology courses, especially when a laboratory is offered and students are taught how to use keys to identify mites to family. Like the previous editions, this hefty volume includes a brief introduction to acarine biology, phylogeny, morphology, ecology, and behavior. A chapter provides detailed information on how to collect and rear mites, as well as how to preserve and slidemount mites. There is an extensive bibliography (114 pages) as well as a systematic (19 pages) and a subject (12 pages) index.

The bulk of the book contains up-to-date information on the classification of mites and keys. Individual chapters with diagnoses and keys are provided for the orders, suborders, and a cohort, with line drawings and other illustrations. Most chapters include keys to families (and in the case of the ticks, keys to genus). This volume includes a new ranking of mite groups compared to the 1978 edition. For example, the order Astigmata (or Acaridida, according to some) is placed in a cohort within the suborder Oribatida, a downgrading of its previous status. Significant other changes also were made in ranking, with the basis for these changes apparently based on morphological analyses rather than the use of molecular phylogenies. This edition indicates there are 6 orders (including the Opilioacaridida, Holothyrida, Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Trombidiformes, Sarcoptiformes) within the subclass Acari.

The identification of mites to family with the keys requires that adult mites (often both males and females) be killed, fixed, and preserved before being slide-mounted for observation under a light microscope. To see the diagnostic characters used in the keys to family or genus, magnifications of 100--1000X are required, and a phase-contrast microscope is highly desirable. As noted by the authors, {\textquotedblleft}Making a good slide mount requires practice and more than a modicum of patience. Pitfalls to be avoided include improper centering of the medium droplet on the slide, using too little medium to accommodate the coverslip, and failure to rinse reactive macerants from the specimen prior to transfer to the mounting medium.{\textquotedblright} Thus, for the novice, getting specimens properly prepared for identification with the keys in this volume is a substantial task.

This volume will be useful to those who are teaching courses in acarology that include laboratories involving mite identification. It will be valuable to serious acarologists everywhere, as well as ecologists and others interested in this highly diverse group of arthropods. The update in references is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the orders. Information on the biology of mites is updated, although in abbreviated form, but those interested in learning more about a specific group may find references leading to more detailed information. Unfortunately, as Lindquist, Krantz, and Walter point out in Chapter 8, {\textquotedblleft}Discoveries of new mite species, genera, and even families have continued apace, and many of these findings have challenged existing familiar- and generic-level concepts.{\textquotedblright} As a result, this volume may have a limited lifespan because new discoveries will lead to different perspectives in the placement of the acarine taxa. However, this valuable volume represents an enormous contribution of time and accumulated wisdom on the part of its expert authors.

It would have been interesting if the authors had compared their ordinal, subordinal, and generic categories, based primarily on morphological traits, with molecular phylogenies. Mites are highly evolved and have lost many taxonomically useful characters; unlike insects, they lack antennae, wings (and thus, venation), and have lost their primitive segmentation patterns. Molecular data indicate that some {\textquoteleft}species{\textquoteright} include cryptic species, indicating that it is likely that the categories and keys presented will need modification as we identify new taxonomic groups.

Despite this quibble, the volume clearly is a labor of love by dedicated acarologists, and is a very significant addition to the acarological literature. Enjoy this volume, because the field of acarology (and entomology) is losing skilled taxonomic specialists at a rapid rate, and any future editions of this book may be at least as long in coming as this one.},

  abstract  = {One of the most cited hypotheses explaining the inordinate success of a small proportion of introduced plants that become pests is the {\textquoteleft}natural enemies hypothesis{\textquoteright}. This states that invasive introduced plants spread rapidly because they are liberated from their co-evolved natural enemies. This hypothesis had not been properly tested until recently. Previous reviews on this topic have been narrative and vote counting in nature. In this review, we carried out quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis using existing literature on plants and their herbivores to test the different components of the enemy release hypothesis. We found supporting evidence in that (1) insect herbivore fauna richness is significantly greater in the native than introduced ranges, and the reduction is skewed disproportionally towards specialists and insects feeding on reproductive parts; and (2) herbivore damage levels are greater on native plants than on introduced invasive congeners. However, herbivore damage levels are only marginally greater for plants in native than in introduced ranges, probably due to the small numbers of this type of study. Studies quantifying herbivore impacts on plant population dynamics are too scarce to make conclusions for either comparison of plants in native vs introduced ranges or of co-occurring native and introduced congeners. For future research, we advocate that more than two-way comparisons between plants in native and introduced ranges, or native and introduced congeners are needed. In addition, the use of herbivore exclusions to quantify the impacts of herbivory on complete sets of population vital rates of native vs introduced species are highly desirable. Furthermore, three-way comparisons among congeners of native plants, introduced invasive, and introduced non-invasive plants can also shed light on the importance of enemy release. Finally, simultaneously testing the enemy release hypothesis and other competing hypotheses will provide significant insights into the mechanisms governing the undesirable success of invasive species.},

  abstract  = {During their long, approximately 350 million-year period of coexistence, plants, insects, and other arthropods
evolved a variety of different interactions (Gatehouse,
2002). Some interactions can be beneficial for the plant,
as in the case of insect-mediated pollination or seed
dispersion, and others are deleterious, as in the case of
attack by herbivorous insects (Fig. 1). To successfully
combat aggressors, plants must be equipped with a
sophisticated sensory system to perceive signals fast
and efficiently from their environment and thereby detect potential enemies and subsequently translate and
integrate such signals into appropriate biochemical and
physiological responses. Thus, upon attack, a number of
reactions are detectable in plant cells, including changes
in ion flux and protein phosphorylation, formation of
reactive oxygen species and oxylipins, as well as initiation of various defense reactions in the host plant (Kessler
and Baldwin, 2002; Maffei et al., 2007b). Intriguing
questions arising from these observations are how
plants recognize the particular herbivores, what kinds
of signals are involved, how such signals are perceived,
and how they are converted into downstream signaling
pathways involved in plant defense activation. Signal
perception in the plant cell may rely on the presence of
specific receptors for chemical signals or on general
recognition processes based on localized tissue injuries.
In principle, the feeding process combines two sites of
the same coin: mechanical wounding of the infested tissue and introduction of oral secretions that are delivered
from the feeding organism into the wounded tissue (i.e.
the attacked plant is challenged by both a mechanical
as well as a chemical stimulus). This Update introduces
herbivore-derived metabolites, which represent serious candidates for signaling compounds; we will also
discuss advances in herbivore recognition, namely, the
perception of insect-derived signals by specific binding
proteins. The properties of these binding proteins suggest their involvement in signal perception.},

The effects of these volatile blends on herbivore behaviour have been investigated to only a limited extent4,5, in part because of the assumption that herbivore-induced volatile emissions occur mainly during the light phase of the photoperiod6,7. Because many moths---whose larvae are some of the most important insect herbivores---are nocturnal, herbivore-induced plant volatiles have not hitherto been considered to be temporally available as host-location cues for ovipositing females. Here we present chemical and behavioural assays showing that tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) release herbivore-induced volatiles during both night and day. Moreover, several volatile compounds are released exclusively at night and are highly repellent to female moths (Heliothis virescens). The demonstration that tobacco plants release temporally different volatile blends and that lepidopteran herbivores use induced plant signals released during the dark phase to choose sites for oviposition adds a new dimension to our understanding of the role of chemical cues in mediating tritrophic interactions.},

Resistance against scab (pathogen: Cladosporium cucumerinum) and the accumulation of chitinase were rapidly induced in cucumber plants after treatment with acibenzolar-S-methyl. In contrast, SA protected the plants from C. cucumerinum and the accumulation of chitinase was induced only on the treated leaves. The accumulation of chitinase in response to inoculation with the pathogen was induced more rapidly in cucumber plants previously treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl than in plants pretreated with SA or water. Thus, it appears that a prospective signal(s), that induces systemic resistance, can be transferred from leaves treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl to the untreated upper and lower leaves where systemic resistance is elicited. In contrast, exogenously applied SA is not likely to function as a mobile, systemic resistance-inducing signal, because SA only induces localized acquired resistance.},

Development, reproduction and predation capacity of the predatory mites were assessed in the first (G1) and sixth generation (G6) of rearing on the different diets. Immature survival rates in G1 were similar on all diets (96.8--100 %). After six generations, however, survival of A. swirskii was significantly reduced on all diets except on A. franciscana cysts. Oviposition rates did not differ between generations when females were fed on E. kuehniella, AD2 or AD3. The total number of deposited eggs was similar among diets except in G6 where the females fed on A. franciscana cysts produced more eggs than those maintained on E. kuehniella eggs. On most diets the intrinsic rates of increase in G1 were superior to those in G6, except for predators supplied with A. franciscana cysts where no differences were observed among generations. Female mites did not lose their capacity to kill first instar Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) after six generations on the different diets, but predation rates in G6 on E. kuehniella were lower than in G1. In conclusion, the different factitious and artificial diets tested in the present study supported the development and reproduction of A. swirskii for a single generation but fitness losses occurred to a varying degree after several generations on E. kuehniella eggs or the artificial diets. Artificial diet enriched with A. franciscana cysts yielded better results than the other artificial diets. Amblyseius swirskii performed best on decapsulated Artemia cysts indicating their potential for use in the mass production of the predator or to sustain its populations in the crop after release.},

When released in a greenhouse inside a circle of cucumber plants that were alternatingly clean or infested with immature whiteflies, the mites took several days to find plants. Both species were recaptured significantly more on plants with whiteflies. This suggests that the mites are able to discriminate between plants with and without whiteflies. The predators may either have been attracted to plants with whiteflies from a distance or arrested on plants with whiteflies.

Typhlodromips swirskii that had previously fed on whitefly immatures on cucumber leaves were significantly attracted by volatiles from cucumber plants with whiteflies in a Y-tube olfactometer. This suggests that the mites use volatile cues to discriminate between infested and clean plants. However, this response waned rapidly; if predators, experienced as above, were starved for 3--4 h in absence of cucumber leaves, they no longer preferred volatiles of infested plants to clean plants. Furthermore, T. swirskii that had no experience with immature whiteflies on cucumber plants also did not prefer odours of infested plants to those of clean plants. Because the release experiment with this species in the greenhouse was done with inexperienced predators, this suggests that the aggregation of mites on plants with whiteflies was mainly caused by differential arrestment of mites on plants with prey and clean plants. For T. swirskii, this was in agreement with the finding that the fraction of predators on plants with prey increased with time to levels higher than 70%. A less clear trend was found for E. scutalis, for which the fraction of predators on plants with prey stabilized soon after release to levels from 54--70%. Hence, the predatory mites may find plants with prey by random searching, but they are subsequently arrested on these plants.

An earlier study showed that 87% of all whiteflies released in a set-up as used here were recaptured within 1 day. Hence, the effectiveness with which predatory mites locate plants with whiteflies is low compared with that of their prey. We expect this to generate spatial patterns in the dynamics of predator and prey and this may have consequences for biological control of whiteflies with predatory mites.},

  abstract  = {Citrus leprosis (CL) is one of the most important viral diseases in sweet orange orchards in Latin America. It is caused by members of at least five species of the so-called Brevipalpus-transmitted viruses (BTV), and the prevalent is Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C). This virus has the broadest host range amongst all CL-associated viruses and is transmitted by Brevipalpus yothersi, a polyphagous mite that can colonize a large variety of host plants, including some spontaneous ground cover plants. But if, on one hand, spontaneous plants can host CL virus and vector, on the other hand, they can offer alternative food for predators, equally common in organic citrus orchards. Brevipalpus yothersi and predator mites were surveyed in 33 spontaneous plants of a Westin sweet orange orchard conducted under organic production system in Brazil, from June 2010 to April 2011. Predatory mites were identified as phytoseiids, and Iphiseiodes zuluagai was the prevalent species, representing 58% of all predators. Other phytoseiids were considered accidental species in the area. Ageratum conyzoides and Alternanthera tenella were the most represented plant host species to predators, comprising 28 and 10% of the total surveyed plants, respectively. Brevipalpus yothersi specimens were detected on various spontaneous species: A. conyzoides, A. tenella, Amaranthus deflexus, Bidens pilosa, Ipomoea quamoclit, I. cairica, Merremia cissoides, Solanum americanum, Panicum maximum, and, predominantly, Commelina benghalensis. The latter has been previously reported as host of CiLV-C as well and, therefore, it is recommended to eliminate this species from citrus orchards.},

PROSPETTIVE DI RICERCA SUGLI ACARI ERIOPHYOIDEA

Gli autori riportano in breve lo stato attuale delle conoscenze sugli Eriophyoidea (Acari, Prostigmata), acari fitofagi obbligati che attaccano molte colture di interesse economico.

Aspetti che richiedono ulteriori approfondimenti di ricerca sono:

1) l{\textquoteright}anatomia della maggior parte degli organi nei diversi stadi di sviluppo, e le differenze tra le forme svernanti (deutogine) e le forme primaverili estive (protogine);

2) le modalit{\`{a}} di induzione delle malformazioni sulle piante, la definizione del ciclo biologico in moltissime specie e l{\textquoteright}attitudine alla trasmissione dei virus e micoplasmi;

3) l{\textquoteright}efficacia di utilizzazione degli eriofidi nella lotta contro le piante infestanti; 4) il ruolo degli eriofidi nelle catene alimentari di acari predatori;
5) l{\textquoteright}organizzazione di un archivio su supporto ad uso informatico.

Parole chiave: Acarologia, galligeni, vaganti, morfologia, anatomia, fisiologia, strategie rirpoduttive, ciclo vitale, ecologia, trasmissione di patogeni vegetali, tassonomia e sistematica.},

  abstract  = {SYNOPSIS. Parthenogenesis is discussed according to type (arrhenotoky, thelytoky, deuteroLoky, artificial parthenogenesis, gynogenesis) and presence in various acarine taxa. Evidence for parthenogenesis is based on rearing and/or cytological studies. Arrhenotoky occurs in Mesostigmata, Prostigmata and Astigmata and usually does not occur sporadically throughout these taxa; when present it operates in many closely related species as the major type of reproduction in certain genera, subfamilies or families. Thelytoky is present in Mesostigmata, Metastigmata, Prostigmata, Astigmata and Cryptostigmata, but in no case is the major mode of reproduction in higher taxa, i.e. subfamilies, families. Its sporadic occurrence may or may not be accompanied by polyploidy. Deuterotoky occurs in one acarine group (Listrophoridae) and artificial parthenogenesis is possible in ticks (Metastigmata). Gynogenesis is present in several species of haplo-diploid Mesostigmata (some Dermanyssidae, Phytoseiidae), although it is usually considered in connection with thelytoky. Current studies of the effects of ploidy level on morphological variation indicate greater character variability in diploid females than in haploid males. In some species of ticks thelytoky is expressed differentially even on an intraspecific level. One geographic strain of a species may have the ability to reproduce thelytokously, but if mated produces males and females.},

  month     = mar,
  abstract  = {Citrus leprosis is an economically important disease of citrus in South and Central America. The disease can be caused by several non-systemic viruses belonging to the genera Cilevirus (family Kitaviridae) and Dichorhavirus (family Rhabdoviridae) (Roy et al. 2015; Freitas-Ast{\'{u}}a et al. 2018). In February 2020, lesions consistent with citrus leprosis were observed on the leaves and stems of rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri) and mandarin (C. reticulata) trees in Hilo, Hawaii. Brevipalpus mites, vector of orchid fleck virus (OFV), were also present on these trees (Freitas-Ast{\'{u}}a et al. 2018). To identify the virus associated with the symptoms, total RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel) and underwent reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with two newly designed universal primers specific for dichorhaviruses (Dichora-R1-F1: 5`-CAYCACTGYGCBRTNGCWGATGA, Dichora-R1-R1: 5`-AGKATRTSWGCCATCCKGGCTATBAG). The expected ~350 bp amplicon was obtained and directly sequenced in both directions. Blastn and Blastx searches revealed that the primer-trimmed consensus sequence (MT232917) shared 99.3% nucleotide (nt) and 100% amino acid (aa) identity with an OFV isolate from Germany (AF321775). OFV has two orchid- (OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2) and two citrus- (OFV-Cit1 and OFV-Cit2) infecting strains (Roy et al. 2020). However, an isolate of OFV-Orc1 has recently been associated with citrus leprosis in South Africa (Cook et al. 2019). To confirm the presence of OFV in Hawaiian citrus and identify the strain, symptomatic tissue was submitted to USDA-APHIS-PPQ-S&T where total RNA were extracted from the symptomatic tissue using RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA samples were tested with OFV-Orc and OFV-Cit generic and specific primers in a conventional RT-PCR assay following optimized RT-PCR protocols (Roy et al. 2020). Two additional sets of generic primers (OFV-Orc-GPF: 5'-AGCGATAACGACCTTGATATGACACC, OFV-Orc-GPR: 5'-TGAGTGGTAGTCAATG CTCCATCAT and OFV-R2-GF1: 5'- CARTGTCAGGAGGATGCATGGAA, OFV-R2-GR: 5'- GACCTGCTTGATGTAATTGCTTCCTTC') were designed based on available OFV phospho (P) and large (L) polyprotein gene sequences in GenBank. These assays detected OFV-Orc2 in the symptomatic citrus samples, with the nucleocapsid (1353 bp), P (626 bp), and L (831 bp) gene sequences sharing 97 to 98% identity with published OFV-Orc2 sequences (AB244417 and AB516441). Ribo-depleted RNA (Ribo-Zero, Illumina) was prepared using a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina) and underwent high throughput sequencing (HTS) on a MiSeq platform (Illumina). The resulting 19.6 million 2x75bp reads were de novo assembled using SPAdes v. 3.10.0 (Bankevitch et al. 2012). In addition to sequences corresponding to citrus tristeza virus and citrus vein enation virus, two contigs of 6,412 nt (average depth 18,821; MW021482) and 5,986 nt (average depth 19,278; MW021483), were found to have $\geq$98% identity to RNA1 (AB244417) and RNA2 (AB244418) of OFV isolate So (Japan), respectively. This is the first report of OFV in Hawaii and the first time leprosis has been observed in the USA since it was eradicated from Florida in the 1960s, although that outbreak was attributed to infection by citrus leprosis virus-N0, a distant relative of OFV (Hartung et al. 2015). The recent detection of citrus leprosis associated with OFV infection in South Africa (Cook et al. 2019) and now Hawaii underscores the threat this pathogen poses to the global citrus industry.},

Only 6.4% of the F0 generation fed only R. indica reaches the adult stage. Adults originating from the F0 generation did not exceed the preoviposition period. Adding Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier) eggs to the diet, the F2 generation presented the following results: 23% reached the adult stage, the embryonic period was 6.5\hspace{0.167em}$\pm$\hspace{0.167em}0.5 d. The longest instar (9.3\hspace{0.167em}$\pm$\hspace{0.167em}2.1 d) was 3\textsuperscript{rd} instar. The adult had an average longevity of 81.7\hspace{0.167em}$\pm$\hspace{0.167em}54.9 d.

  abstract  = {Biological control is an important ecosystem service delivered by natural enemies. Together with breeding for plant defence, it constitutes one of the most promising alternatives to pesticides for controlling herbivores in sustainable crop production. Especially induced plant defences may be promising targets in plant breeding for resistance against arthropod pests. Because they are activated upon herbivore damage, costs are only incurred when defence is needed. Moreover, they can be more specific than constitutive defences. Nevertheless, inducible defence traits that are harming plant pest organisms may interfere with biological control agents, such as predators and parasitoids. Despite the vast fundamental knowledge on plant defence mechanisms and their effects on natural enemies, our understanding of the feasibility of combining biological control with induced plant defence in practice is relatively poor. In this review, we focus on arthropod pest control and present the most important features of biological control with natural enemies and of induced plant defence. Furthermore, we show potential synergies and conflicts among them and, finally, identify gaps and list opportunities for their combined use in crop protection. We suggest that breeders should focus on inducible resistance traits that are compatible with the natural enemies of arthropod pests, specifically traits that help communities of natural enemies to build up.},

  abstract  = {Brevipalpus mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) carrying citrus leprosis virus are considered serious quarantine pests. The objective of this research was to clarify the effectiveness of commonly used fruit cleaners, soaps, waxes, and mechanical brushing techniques (alone and in combination) on removal and/or mortality of mites (percentage of density reduction) from infested citrus fruits. Six bioassays were conducted with infested lemons, Citrus limon (L.) Burm.f. (Sapindales: Rutaceae), using non-virulent Brevipalpus yothersi Baker as a model species. In each bioassay, all stages (eggs, nymphs, and adults) of B. yothersi were recorded before and after treatment. Results indicated that none of the treatments provided 100% reduction of all stages of mites, as would be required for quarantine treatments. In general, mite reduction following single treatments (soap rinse, brushing, or waxing alone) was not significantly different from reduction obtained with a water drench control. However, several combination treatments were successful in achieving $\sim$90% reduction of mites, particularly those that included application of a food-grade wax coating. Therefore, a combination of treatments, including a soap wash and mechanical brushing followed by a wax coating, may be the most effective method to achieve significant reduction of all stages of Brevipalpus mites from infested citrus. Espec{\'{i}}menes de Brevipalpus yothersi (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) que sean vectores de la leprosis de los c{\'{i}}tricos se consideran plagas cuarentenarias. El objetivo de esta investigaci{\'{o}}n fue el de clarificar la efectividad de substancias utilizadas para limpiar la fruta como jabones, ceras y t{\'{e}}cnicas como el cepillado mec{\'{a}}nico de los frutos (utilizadas singularmente o en combinaci{\'{o}}n) sobre la remoci{\'{o}}n o mortalidad causada en los {\'{a}}caros infestando frutos de c{\'{i}}tricos. Se hicieron seis bioensayos probando los tratamientos mencionados antes en lim{\'{o}}n Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f. (Sapindales: Rutaceae), usando, Brevipalpus yothersi Baker no-virulento como especie modelo. En cada bioensayo todos los estados (huevos, estados inmaduros y adultos) de B. yothersi infestando limones, fueron evaluados antes y despu{\'{e}}s de tratamiento. Los resultados indicaron que ninguno de los tratamientos causaba el 100% de reducci{\'{o}}n de todos los estados de los {\'{a}}caros, lo cual es requerido en tratamientos de cuarentena. En general, la reducci{\'{o}}n de {\'{a}}caros despu{\'{e}}s de un solo tratamiento (jabones, limpiadores, cepillado o encerado solo) no fue significativamente diferente del testigo representado por la inmersi{\'{o}}n de los limones en agua.

This review presents a general overview of classical and contemporary findings about etiology, serology, epidemiology, pathology, molecular biology, detection and prevention methods of orchid fleck virus. Because of the characteristics of OFV and viruses of the Rhabdoviridae and Mononegavirales, it is proposed that a new genus of negative-sense RNA plant viruses outside of the Mononegavirales be established with orchid fleck virus as the type species.},

  abstract  = {Citrus leprosis (CL) is a viral disease endemic to the Western Hemisphere that produces local necrotic and chlorotic lesions on leaves, branches, and fruit and causes serious yield reduction in citrus orchards. Samples of sweet orange (Citrus $\times$ sinensis) trees showing CL symptoms were collected during a survey in noncommercial citrus areas in the southeast region of Brazil in 2013 to 2016. Transmission electron microscopy analyses of foliar lesions confirmed the presence of rod-like viral particles commonly associated with CL in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells. However, every attempt to identify these particles by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests failed, even though all described primers for the detection of known CL-causing cileviruses and dichorhaviruses were used. Next-generation sequencing of total RNA extracts from three symptomatic samples revealed the genome of distinct, although highly related (>92% nucleotide sequence identity), viruses whose genetic organization is similar to that of dichorhaviruses. The genome sequence of these viruses showed 62% nucleotide sequence identity with those of orchid fleck virus and coffee ringspot virus. Globally, the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames they encode share 32.7 to 63.8% identity with the proteins of the dichorhavirids. Mites collected from both the naturally infected citrus trees and those used for the transmission of one of the characterized isolates to Arabidopsis plants were anatomically recognized as Brevipalpus phoenicis sensu stricto. Molecular and biological features indicate that the identified viruses belong to a new species of CL-associated dichorhavirus, which we propose to call Citrus leprosis N dichorhavirus. Our results, while emphasizing the increasing diversity of viruses causing CL disease, lead to a reevaluation of the nomenclature of those viruses assigned to the genus Dichorhavirus. In this regard, a comprehensive discussion is presented.},

Beentje & J. Dransf., Arecaceae. It is likely that the presence of the pest is restricted yet, because this plant was imported from Brazil for garden ornamentation. Visual observations were made in other nurseries of the same locality; however, the red mite has not been detected. Therefore, it is necessary to permanently monitor the host plants, also in banana plantations in order to verify the occurrence of the red mite, and implement integrated management and prevent its spread. The mite is a threat to the production of bananas; a sector of great economic importance which benefits the small producer, it is the most consumed fruit in the country and besides it is exported.},

By 2008, it spread to at least twelve islands, to two counties in Florida and to Venezuela. Red palm mite causes yellowing and leaf necrosis with severe reduction of leaf stomatal conductance. Growers are reporting > 70% reduction in coconut yield. Genetic studies of red palm mite collected from multiple regions in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean revealed several distinct haplotypes. All Caribbean samples have the same haplotype, which matches samples from coconut in R{\'{e}}union and areca palms in India. The populations from coconut in India exhibited a different haplotype. Biological control and pesticide options are being studied to manage the pest. The efficacy of acaricides against red palm mite was tested to provide palm, banana and ornamental nursery growers with an updated list of acaricides with good control potential. Natural enemy studies in the Caribbean have shown that thrips, phytoseiid, lacewing, and coccinelid predators attack red palm mites. Fungal infections have been reported in Puerto Rico, Dominica and Trinidad. Predatory mite numbers, especially in the Phytoseiidae, increase in response to higher numbers of red palm mites. However, these local predators are apparently not controlling red palm mite outbreaks. Foreign exploration for natural enemies is being conducted in Mauritius and India. A phytoseiid predator is currently being evaluated in quarantine in Gainesville, Florida.},

  abstract  = {Red palm mites (Raoiella indica Hirst, Acari: Tenuipalpidae) were first observed in the western hemisphere on the islands and countries surrounding the Caribbean Sea, infesting the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera L.). Detection of invasive pests usually relies upon changes in vegetation properties as result of the pest activity. These changes may be visible in time series of satellite data records, such as Landsat satellites, which have been available with a 16-day repeat cycle at a spatial resolution of 30 m since 1982. Typical red palm mite infestations result in the yellowing of the lower leaves of the palm crown; remote sensing model simulations have indicated that this feature may be better detected using the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI). Using the Google Earth Engine programming environment, a time series of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data was generated for plantations in northern and northeast Brazil, El Salvador, and Trinidad-Tobago. Considering the available studied plantations, there were little or no differences of GNDVI before and after the dates when red palm mites were first revealed at each location. A discussion of possible alternative approaches are discussed related to the limitations of the current satellite platforms.},

  abstract  = {Evidence suggests that certain taxonomic groups are more thoroughly studied than others across a wide range of biological disciplines. Such taxonomic biases have the potential to define our understanding of theory, and limit the generality of our insights. To assess the distribution of taxonomic representation in current and historical animal behaviour research, we constructed a data set containing article metrics and taxonomic information for all research articles published in the journal Animal Behaviour between 1953 and 2015. We found significant taxonomic bias, with chordate papers making up 70% of all publications in the past 15 years, despite accounting for less than 7% of all animal species. Within chordates, Animal Behaviour content is biased towards endotherms, with birds and mammals comprising more than 50% of all publications. In sum, six animal orders account for more than half of all publications, with the most commonly published order, Passeriformes, representing one in five articles. Our findings confirm that a relatively narrow group of {\textquoteleft}model{\textquoteright} taxa represent the vast majority of articles, and may have a disproportionate influence on our understanding of behavioural patterns and processes. Furthermore, we find evidence of a citation bias, with chordate studies receiving on average four citations more per paper than arthropod studies. While historical trends suggest that the publication gap between arthropods and chordates has been shrinking for the past 45 years, our findings show that a considerable bias still remains. These biases may originate from human preferences for certain animal types, but we argue that they are likely maintained by a mixture of taxonomic prejudices, cultural aspects of behavioural ecology as a field, and of academia in general.

Whereas there is evidence that some pathogens suppress these defences by interfering with signalling pathways involved in the defence, such evidence is scarce for herbivores. We found that the invasive spider mite Tetranychus evansi suppresses the induction of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling routes involved in induced plant defences in tomato. This was reflected in the levels of inducible defence compounds, such as proteinase inhibitors, which in mite-infested plants were reduced to even lower levels than the constitutive levels in herbivore-free plants. Additionally, the spider mite suppressed the release of inducible volatiles, which are implicated in plant defence. Consequently, the mites performed much better on previously attacked plants than on non-attacked plants. These findings provide a new perspective on plant--herbivore interactions, plant protection and plant resistance to invasive species.},

In a previous study, the taxonomic status of A. tosichella in Australia was assessed using molecular markers. A. tosichella was shown to consist of two genetically distinct lineages likely to represent different species. Here we show that both lineages occupy similar distributions, occurring throughout the entire Australian wheat belt, and that the lineages are often found in sympatry. CLIMEX analysis suggests that tolerance to heat and desiccation limit the distribution of A. tosichella. In the laboratory, only one WCM lineage transmitted WSMV virus under controlled conditions. These results have implications for the management of WCM and WSMV within Australia.},

  abstract  = {Because of their size, small arthropods can be highly affected by characteristics of the leaf surface. Leaf surfaces have various structures, such as trichomes and domatia, which add to the complexity of the microenvironment experienced by arthropods. Plant structure can affect the retention and performance of predators and parasitoids and it has been proposed that phylloplane characteristics be modified to improve the utility of these organisms as biological control agents. Phytoseiids have a long history as biological control agents of pest mite species in agricultural systems. In the past 30 years, extensive research has shown that trichomes and domatia influence phytoseiid populations and performance. Various reasons have been proposed to explain this relationship, including increased pollen capture for use as a food source, escape from predation, avoidance of adverse abiotic conditions, and increased/decreased ease of prey capture. There is potential for the manipulation of crops to improve biological control by phytoseiids, but incorporating beneficial traits into plants is likely to have lower priority than other breeding characteristics. The objectives of this review are to summarize the evidence for the relationship between phytoseiids and leaf surface structures, discuss possible hypotheses to explain this relationship, examine the potential of altering current crop varieties for the purpose of increasing phytoseiid populations or performance, and conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the effects of plant surface structures on phytoseiid and phytophagous mite densities.},

  abstract  = {Plant morphological traits such as leaf pubescence may affect herbivores and their natural enemies at the individual, population and community levels. Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator-herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator--predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three-pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad-leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.},

We recently developed plant-attached shelters containing sachets and felt patches, called {\textquotedblleft}sheltered sachets{\textquotedblright}, to protect predators against pesticides and wet conditions, and enhance their release to crops. However, this release system appeared to be vulnerable to dry ambient environments. To address this problem, we developed {\textquotedblleft}moisturized sheltered sachets{\textquotedblright}, containing water-absorbed polymers as a humidifier, and investigated the numbers of Neoseiulus californicus and Amblyseius swirskii released from three different release systems, at low, moderate, and high RH. Irrespective of predator species and RH (excepting A. swirskii at high RH), more predators were released from the moisturized sheltered sachets than from the sheltered sachets and/or normal sachets. Thus, moisturized sheltered sachets appear to be potentially useful for the efficient predator release in a wide range of humidity environments.},

  abstract  = {The cereal rust mite Abacarus hystrix (Nalepa), a significant pest of grasses, has been regarded as one of a few exceptions among eriophyoid mites with reference to the pattern of host plant utilization. At least 60 grass species have been recorded as its hosts. Thus, the mite has long been considered as a host generalist in which host specialization would not be likely to evolve. However, recent studies have revealed that host-associated specialization is possible in A. hystrix. Here, we aimed to discriminate between the three populations of A. hystrix associated with the different hosts (namely quackgrass, ryegrass and smooth brome) on the basis of mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (D2 region of 28S rDNA) DNA sequences. The phylogenetic trees obtained with the maximum likelihood analysis of both COI and D2 region data sets showed that host-adapted strains of A. hystrix form distinct clades. Furthermore, on the COI nucleotide tree, the quackgrass- and brome-associated strains were internally divided each into two well-supported monophyletic clusters. The nucleotide D2 region data set tree showed that brome-associated strain is polyphyletic in origin. There is clear co-variation of DNA results with earlier morphological and ecological traits, as well as the results of crossing experiments. We showed that reproductively incompatible strains of A. hystrix exhibit more than 20% sequence divergence in the COI gene and 0.2% sequence divergence in the D2 28S rDNA. Our results did not confirm the placement of three host-associated strains of A. hystrix within one, ostensibly generalist, species.},

During feeding they release chemical cues that allow plants to detect the attack and mount an efficient defense response. A signaling cascade triggers the expression of hundreds of genes, which encode defensive proteins and enzymes for synthesis of toxic metabolites. This direct defense is often complemented by emission of volatiles that attract beneficial parasitoids. In return, arthropods have evolved strategies to interfere with plant defenses, either by producing effectors to inhibit detection and downstream signaling steps, or by adapting to their detrimental effect. In this review, we address the current knowledge on the molecular and chemical dialog between plants and herbivores, with an emphasis on co-evolutionary aspects.},

The results indicate that BTH treatment led to enhanced activities of $\beta$-1,3-glucanase and chitinase in the intercellular spaces of rose leaves. An increase in extracellular $\beta$-1,3-glucanase and chitinase activities was also found in D. rosae-infected leaves. However, the increase in enzyme activities occurred much more rapidly and was more strongly enhanced in D. rosae-infected leaves that were previously treated with BTH, suggesting that the increased $\beta$-1,3-glucanase and chitinase may play a role in restricting the development of disease symptoms on the rose leaves infected with D. rosae. The expression patterns of rose $\beta$-1,3-glucanase and chitinase isoforms were investigated on native PAGE with specific staining techniques. A similar induction pattern of these enzymes was observed in both treatments. The increased $\beta$-1,3-glucanase and chitinase activities are mainly due to the enhanced expression of $\beta$-1,3-glucanase isoform G2 and chitinase isoforms C1 and C2. These isoforms are likely to be a part of rose defense responses to pathogen attack.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of land plants approximately 470 million years ago created a new adaptive zone for natural enemies (attackers) of plants. In response to attack, plants evolved highly effective, inducible defense systems. Two plant hormones modulating inducible defenses are salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Current thinking is that SA induces resistance against biotrophic pathogens and some phloem feeding insects and JA induces resistance against necrotrophic pathogens, some phloem feeding insects and chewing herbivores. Signaling crosstalk between SA and JA commonly manifests as a reciprocal antagonism and may be adaptive, but this remains speculative. We examine evidence for and against adaptive explanations for antagonistic crosstalk, trace its phylogenetic origins and provide a hypothesis-testing framework for future research on the adaptive significance of SA--JA crosstalk.},

  abstract  = {1. The negative effect of induced plant resistance on the preference and performance of herbivores is a well-documented ecological phenomenon that is thought to be important for both plants and herbivores. This study links the well-developed mechanistic understanding of the biochemistry of induced plant resistance in the tomato system with an examination of how these mechanisms affect the community of herbivores in the field.

2. Several proteins that are induced in tomato foliage following herbivore damage have been linked causally to reductions in herbivore performance under laboratory conditions. Application of jasmonic acid, a natural elicitor of these defensive proteins, to tomato foliage stimulates induced responses to herbivory.

3. Jasmonic acid was sprayed on plants in three doses to generate plants with varying levels of induced responses, which were measured as increases in the activities of proteinase inhibitors and polyphenol oxidase.

4. Field experiments conducted over 3\hspace{1em}years indicated that induction of these defensive proteins is associated with decreases in the abundance of all four naturally abundant herbivores, including insects in three feeding guilds, caterpillars, flea beetles, aphids, and thrips. Induced resistance killed early instars of noctuid caterpillars. Adult flea beetles strongly preferred control plants over induced plants, and this effect on host plant preference probably contributed to differences in the natural abundance of flea beetles.

5. The general nature of the effects observed in this study suggests that induced resistance will suppress many members of the herbivore community. By linking plant biochemistry, insect preference, performance, and abundance, tools can be developed to manipulate plant resistance sensibly and to predict its outcome under field conditions.},

  abstract  = {Over the last 25 years, research on biodiversity has expanded dramatically, fuelled by increasing threats to the natural world. However, the number of published studies is heavily weighted towards certain taxa, perhaps influencing conservation awareness of and funding for less-popular groups. Few studies have systematically quantified these biases, although information on this topic is important for informing future research and conservation priorities. We investigated: i) which animal taxa are being studied; ii) if any taxonomic biases are the same in temperate and tropical regions; iii) whether the taxon studied is named in the title of papers on biodiversity, perhaps reflecting a perception of what biodiversity is; iv) the geographical distribution of biodiversity research, compared with the distribution of biodiversity and threatened species; and v) the geographical distribution of authors{\textquoteright} countries of origin. To do this, we used the search engine Web of Science to systematically sample a subset of the published literature with {\textquoteleft}biodiversity{\textquoteright} in the title. In total 526 research papers were screened---5% of all papers in Web of Science with biodiversity in the title. For each paper, details on taxonomic group, title phrasing, number of citations, study location, and author locations were recorded. Compared to the proportions of described species, we identified a considerable taxonomic weighting towards vertebrates and an under-representation of invertebrates (particularly arachnids and insects) in the published literature. This discrepancy is more pronounced in highly cited papers, and in tropical regions, with only 43% of biodiversity research in the tropics including invertebrates. Furthermore, while papers on vertebrate taxa typically did not specify the taxonomic group in the title, the converse was true for invertebrate papers. Biodiversity research is also biased geographically: studies are more frequently carried out in developed countries with larger economies, and for a given level of species or threatened species, tropical countries were understudied relative to temperate countries. Finally, biodiversity research is disproportionately authored by researchers from wealthier countries, with studies less likely to be carried out by scientists in lower-GDP nations. Our results highlight the need for a more systematic and directed evaluation of biodiversity studies, perhaps informing more targeted research towards those areas and taxa most depauperate in research. Only by doing so can we ensure that biodiversity research yields results that are relevant and applicable to all regions and that the information necessary for the conservation of threatened species is available to conservation practitioners.},

  abstract  = {Hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) catalyze the cleavage of fatty acid hydroperoxides to aldehydes and oxoacids. These volatile aldehydes play a major role in forming the aroma of many plant fruits and flowers. In addition, they have antimicrobial activity in vitro and thus are thought to be involved in the plant defense response against pest and pathogen attack. An HPL activity present in potato leaves has been characterized and shown to cleave specifically 13-hydroperoxides of both linoleic and linolenic acids to yield hexanal and 3-hexenal, respectively, and 12-oxo-dodecenoic acid. A cDNA encoding this HPL has been isolated and used to monitor gene expression in healthy and mechanically damaged potato plants. HPL gene expression is subject to developmental control, being high in young leaves and attenuated in older ones, and it is induced weakly by wounding. HPL enzymatic activity, nevertheless, remains constant in leaves of different ages and also after wounding, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may regulate its activity levels. Antisense-mediated HPL depletion in transgenic potato plants has identified this enzyme as a major route of 13-fatty acid hydroperoxide degradation in the leaves. Although these transgenic plants have highly reduced levels of both hexanal and 3-hexenal, they show no phenotypic differences compared with wild-type ones, particularly in regard to the expression of wound-induced genes. However, aphids feeding on the HPL-depleted plants display approximately a two-fold increase in fecundity above those feeding on nontransformed plants, consistent with the hypothesis that HPL-derived products have a negative impact on aphid performance. Thus, HPL-catalyzed production of C6 aldehydes may be a key step of a built-in resistance mechanism of plants against some sucking insect pests.},

  abstract  = {The intense spraying of pesticides to control different arthropod pests has resulted in negative side effects for the management of pests. It was previously discovered that exposure to non-acaricidal insecticides alone or in a mixture, results in lower efficiency of the acaricide spirodiclofen used for Brevipalpus spp. control. We investigate here whether the induced expression of detoxification enzymes by non-lethal insecticides may antagonize spirodiclofen toxicity. Brevipalpus californicus mites exposed to the insecticide phosmet alone or in combination with spirodiclofen showed increased activity of P450 monooxygenases (P450s). No antagonistic effects in mite mortality were observed by the combination of phosmet and spirodiclofen. On the other hand, mites exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid alone or in combination with spirodiclofen showed an increase in the activity of P450s, carboxylcholinesterases (CCE), and glutathione-S-transferases (GST). An antagonistic effect on mite mortality was observed when mites were exposed to the LC25 of spirodiclofen combined with the field rate treatment of imidacloprid. The addition of PBO (a P450 monooxygenase inhibitor) to the mixture of spirodiclofen and imidacloprid resulted in a synergistic effect over mite mortality but the addition of DEM (a GST inhibitor) resulted in an antagonist effect. Taken together, this study showed that the combination of imidacloprid with spirodiclofen is antagonistic for the control of B. californicus, and this results from the induction of detoxification enzymes, such as P450s, CCE, and GST. The use of inhibitors highlights the role of these enzymes in the antagonism of the mixture.},

The role of calcium in the detection of abiotic stress is well documented; however, its role during biotic interactions remains unclear. Here, we use a fluorescent calcium biosensor (GCaMP3) in combination with the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) as a tool to study Arabidopsis thaliana calcium dynamics in vivo and in real time during a live biotic interaction. We demonstrate rapid and highly localized plant calcium elevations around the feeding sites of M. persicae, and by monitoring aphid feeding behavior electrophysiologically, we demonstrate that these elevations correlate with aphid probing of epidermal and mesophyll cells. Furthermore, we dissect the molecular mechanisms involved, showing that interplay between the plant defense coreceptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1), the plasma membrane ion channels GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 and 3.6 (GLR3.3 and GLR3.6), and the vacuolar ion channel TWO-PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) mediate these calcium elevations. Consequently, we identify a link between plant perception of biotic threats by BAK1, cellular calcium entry mediated by GLRs, and intracellular calcium release by TPC1 during a biologically relevant interaction.},

This review surveys how SA in plants regulates both local disease resistance mechanisms, including host cell death and defense gene expression, and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Genetic studies reveal an increasingly complex network of proteins required for SA-mediated defense signaling, and this process is amplified by several regulatory feedback loops. The interaction between the SA signaling pathway and those regulated by other plant hormones and/or defense signals is also discussed.},

  abstract  = {More than 40,000 species of mites have been described, and up to 1 million may exist on earth. These tiny arachnids play many ecological roles including acting as vectors of disease, vital players in soil formation, and important agents of biological control. But despite the grand diversity of mites, even trained biologists are often unaware of their significance. Mites: Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour (2\textsuperscript{nd} edition) aims to fill the gaps in our understanding of these intriguing creatures. It surveys life cycles, feeding behaviour, reproductive biology and host-associations of mites without requiring prior knowledge of their morphology or taxonomy. Topics covered include evolution of mites and other arachnids, mites in soil and water, mites on plants and animals, sperm transfer and reproduction, mites and human disease, and mites as models for ecological and evolutionary theories.},

The effects of jasmonic acid (JA) at 1.5 and 2.5 mM, and acibenzolar-S-methyl (benzothiadiazole, BTH) at 0.5 and 1.5 mM, applied separately or together, on the fecundity of T. urticae females in a laboratory test as well as on the population growth of the pest in a greenhouse experiment were determined. The influence of both elicitors on the induction of LOX and PAL gene expression was assessed in a parallel experiment using real-time PCR. Jasmonic acid showed significantly higher effectiveness in inducing apple tree resistance to T. urticae, as compared to BTH. This was particularly evident in the reduction in pest numbers that was observed in the greenhouse experiment and was also confirmed by increased LOX gene expression after treatment with JA. BTH induced the expression of the PAL gene more strongly than jasmonic acid; however, this was not reflected in the performance of the two-spotted spider mite in the laboratory and greenhouse experiments. It was also found that the antagonistic effect of BTH on JA might lead to decreased effectiveness of the jasmonic acid used to induce apple tree resistance to the two-spotted spider mite. Although nitrogen fertilization stimulated the development of spider mite populations, the resistance induction mechanism was more effective in N-fertilized plants, which was especially evident at the higher jasmonic acid concentration.},

SAR is characterized by the development of a diseaseresistant state in plants that have reacted hypersensitively to previous infection by tobacco mosaic virus. Here, we show that the onset of SAR correlates with the coordinate induction of nine classes of mRNAs. Salicylic acid, a candidate for the endogenous signal that activates the resistant state, induces expression of the same {\textquotedblleft}SAR genes.{\textquotedblright} A novel synthetic immunization compound, methyl-2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid, also induces both resistance and SAR gene expression. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that induced resistance results at least partially from coordinate expression of these SAR genes. A model is presented that ties pathogeninduced necrosis to the biosynthesis of salicylic acid and the induction of SAR.},

that negative population-density and -size dependency limited the reproduction of foundresses, where the
effects of population size on population growth overweighed that of population density. We further demonstrate
that ovipositing females could accelerate population growth rate (intrinsic rate of increase, rm) at higher
population sizes by producing more daughters early during their lifespan, which can be an adaptive strategy to
allow more daughters to complete development and disperse to reduce future food competition intensity. This
study provided knowledge on population dynamics in response to foundress population density and size in
general and T. ludeni population forecast and precise timing of pest management in particular.},

Recently, data from conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to facilitate the descriptions and complement the information that has been historically obtained with the light microscope. However, the conventional preparation techniques associated with SEM frequently prevent or compromise the results. This study evaluated the use of low-temperature field emission SEM to image mites and their hosts. Results indicated that a modified cryofixation procedure, which was associated with this technique, retained the mites at their living/feeding sites in natural behavioral positions. Furthermore, the turgor of the specimens, even eggs and soft-bodied species, was also maintained. The structure and orientation of delicate structures such as setae, which would be subjected to mechanical damage during conventional chemical fixation, dehydration, and drying, were also preserved after cryofixation. Field emission SEM, which provided useful magnification beyond that attainable with a conventional SEM, also enabled resolution of ultrastructural features, such as tenent hairs on the empodium and pores on the dorsal surface that had not previously been observed. These advantages indicate that the low-temperature field emission SEM can provide important structural data that can be used to study the anatomy, morphology, and bioecology of mites.},

The present study established ornamental peppers as banker plants supporting Amblyseius swirskii (Acari: Phytoseiidae) against the three pests. Specifically, this study (a) evaluated survival and population buildup of A. swirskii on three ornamental pepper varieties, Masquerade (MA), Red Missile (RM), and Explosive Ember (EE) in both laboratory and greenhouses and (b) determined the predation of A. swirskii reared on ornamental pepper plants to the targeted pests under greenhouse conditions. The results showed that the three pepper varieties were excellent banker plants and able to support at least $\sim$1000 of all stages of A. swirskii per plant in greenhouse conditions and allow them to complete their life cycle. A. swirskii dispersed or released from the banker plants to target plants, resulting in significant suppression of the three pests, i.e., after 14 d post-release, a significantly lower average of 2.75 B. tabaci and 13.4 all stages of thrips (chilli thrips and western flower thrips) were found per bean plant, respectively, compared to 379.5 B. tabaci and 235.4 all stages of thrips per plant in the control. Furthermore, our experiment observed that the sweet pepper seedlings closed to banker plants were healthy, whereas those without banker plants were heavily infested by chilli thrips; their growth seriously stunted or died. This is the first report of ornamental pepper as banker plants supporting A. swirskii against three notorious pests. This established banker plant system could be a new addition to the integrated pest management programs for sustainable control of these three pests in greenhouse vegetables.},

Treatment with BNR 48 h prior to their challenge also elicited a significant and systemic increase in all cellular fractions of peroxidases, 1,3-beta-glucanases, and chitinases compared with the diseased and control plants. Compared with control plants, total peroxidases and glucanases increased twofold and eightfold, respectively, in all protected bean tissues. BNR 232-CG could not be recovered from the challenged hypocotyls or cotyledons, indicating that there was no contact between the inducer and the pathogen. Both the 1,3-beta-glucanases and the peroxidases were positively correlated with induced resistance.},

  abstract  = {The basal defenses important in curtailing the development of the phloem-feeding silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci type B; SLWF) on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were investigated. Sentinel defense gene RNAs were monitored in SLWF-infested and control plants. Salicylic acid (SA)-responsive gene transcripts accumulated locally (PR1, BGL2, PR5, SID2, EDS5, PAD4) and systemically (PR1, BGL2, PR5) during SLWF nymph feeding. In contrast, jasmonic acid (JA)- and ethylene-dependent RNAs (PDF1.2, VSP1, HEL, THI2.1, FAD3, ERS1, ERF1) were repressed or not modulated in SLWF-infested leaves. To test for a role of SA and JA pathways in basal defense, SLWF development on mutant and transgenic lines that constitutively activate or impair defense pathways was determined. By monitoring the percentage of SLWF nymphs in each instar, we show that mutants that activate SA defenses (cim10) or impair JA defenses (coi1) accelerated SLWF nymphal development. Reciprocally, mutants that activate JA defenses (cev1) or impair SA defenses (npr1, NahG) slowed SLWF nymphal development. Furthermore, when npr1 plants, which do not activate downstream SA defenses, were treated with methyl jasmonate, a dramatic delay in nymph development was observed. Collectively, these results showed that SLWF-repressed, JA-regulated defenses were associated with basal defense to the SLWF.},

Numbers of researches have been carried out in the model plants such as arabidopsis, tobacco, rice and so on, however, with little work done in woody plants especially in fruit trees such as apple. Components of the pathway of SAR seem to be extremely conserved in the variety of species. Malus hupehensis, which is origin in China, is strong resistance with rootstock. In the study, we attempted to make the expression pattern of pathogenesis related (PR) genes which were downstream components of the SAR pathway in response to salicylic acid(SA), methyl jasmonate(MeJA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid(ACC) in Malus hupehensis.},

  abstract  = {Plants under herbivore attack are able to initiate indirect defense by synthesizing and releasing complex blends of volatiles that attract natural enemies of the herbivore. However, little is known about how plants respond to infestation by multiple herbivores, particularly if these belong to different feeding guilds. Here, we report the interference by a phloem-feeding insect, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, with indirect plant defenses induced by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) in Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants. Additional whitefly infestation of spider-mite infested plants resulted in a reduced attraction of predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) compared to attraction to plants infested by spider mites only. This interference is shown to result from the reduction in (E)-$\beta$-ocimene emission from plants infested by both spider mites and whiteflies. When using exogenous salicylic acid (SA) application to mimic B. tabaci infestation, we observed similar results in behavioral and chemical analyses. Phytohormone and gene-expression analyses revealed that B. tabaci infestation, as well as SA application, inhibited spider mite-induced jasmonic acid (JA) production and reduced the expression of two JA-regulated genes, one of which encodes for the P. lunatus enzyme $\beta$-ocimene synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of (E)-$\beta$-ocimene. Remarkably, B. tabaci infestation concurrently inhibited SA production induced by spider mites. We therefore conclude that in dual-infested Lima bean plants the suppression of the JA signaling pathway by whitefly feeding is not due to enhanced SA levels.},

  abstract  = {Brevipalpus obovatus Donnadieu is an important pest mite on tea plants in South China. In the current study, predatory mites of B. obovatus in the tea gardens of Guangzhou were extensively surveyed. In total, 13 species of predatory mites (four families with seven genera) were recorded. The population proportion of Amblyseius hainanensis Wu et Qian was the highest (68.6 %), followed by that of Anystis baccarum (L.) (8.4 %) and A. theae Wu (6.3 %). The effects of starvation time, habitat size and pest population density on the predatory efficiency of the most dominant species, A. hainanensis, feeding on B. obovatus were assessed. In addition, the effectiveness of artificial rainfall in reducing B. obovatus populations was evaluated. After starvation for 48 h, the predatory efficiency of A. hainanensis was significantly higher than those that had been starved for 24 or 72 h when 30--50 B. obovatus eggs were made available. The predation of A. hainanensis on B. obovatus also increased with increasing prey density. The number of prey attacked by A. hainanensis in a 3.2 cm2 habitat was significantly higher than in a 6.3 cm2 habitat. The average predation of A. hainanensis was 31.7 eggs per day when offered 100 B. obovatus eggs on a tea leaf. This decreased to 17.8 eggs per day when four A. hainanensis shared 100 B. obovatus eggs. B. obovatus populations can be reduced by artificial rainfall, with the reduction affected by rainfall intensity. With an intensity of 40 mm in 15 min, 90.2 % mortality of B. obovatus occurred; lower mortalities were recorded (13.3 and 29.8 %) when the intensity was 2 or 4 mm in 15 min. Combination of the predatory mite A. hainanensis and artificial rainfall for the integrated pest management of B. obovatus is discussed.},
