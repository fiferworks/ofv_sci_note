The damage ranging from the defoliation accentuated, premature fall of fruits and loss of quality. This work was carried out a study to identify the stainoverride in coffee farms in Western Bahia, Brazil. In Lu{\'{i}}s Eduardo Magalh{\~{a}}es and S{\~{a}}o Desiderio counties, located in Western Bahia - Brazil, were observed incidences up to 45,6% of coffee plants with ringspot symptoms. Mechanical inoculation of infected material in indicator plants for viruses, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Amaranthus deflexus and Chenopodium quinoa induced typical symptoms confirming the infection by Coffee ringspot virus (CoRSV). This is the first record of CoRSV in Western Bahia, indicating that this virus probably is present in all coffee plantations of the region, established in places with higher temperatures, since this is a factor considered ideal for viral multiplication.},

Molecular diagnostic tools provide valuable support for the rapid and accurate identification of morphologically indistinct alien species. However, these tools currently lack standardization. They are not conducive to adaptation by multiple sectors or countries, or to coping with changing pest priorities. The data presented here identifies DNA barcodes as a very promising opportunity to address this. DNA of tussock moth and fruit fly specimens intercepted at the New Zealand border over the last decade were reanalysed using the cox1 sequence barcode approach. Species identifications were compared with the historical dataset obtained by PCR--RFLP of nuclear rDNA. There was 90 and 96% agreement between the methods for these species, respectively. Improvements included previous tussock moth {\textquoteleft}unknowns{\textquoteright} being placed to family, genera or species and further resolution within fruit fly species complexes. The analyses highlight several advantages of DNA barcodes, especially their adaptability and predictive value. This approach is a realistic platform on which to build a much more flexible system, with the potential to be adopted globally for the rapid and accurate identification of invasive alien species.},

  abstract  = {Balaustium medicagoense Meyer & Ryke (Acari: Erythraeidae) and Bryobia spp. Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) are significant emerging pests in Australian grains and pastures. Despite this, there is limited information known on their basic biology, such as species status and reproductive modes, making it difficult to develop effective and sustainable control strategies. The species/strain status of Balaustium and Bryobia mites from southern Australia was examined using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. In addition, the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method was used to examine the reproductive mode and genetic diversity of Ba. medicagoense from 16 populations within southern Australia. Results indicate that there is only one species of Balaustium (Ba. medicagoense) and as many as seven species of Bryobia mites currently present in grain crops, pastures and roadsides within southern Australia. The Bryobia species complex consists of four recently described lineages (Bryobia sp. I, Bryobia sp. IV, Bryobia sp. VII, and Bryobia praetiosa Koch) and three additional genetic lineages (Bryobia sp. VIII, Bryobia sp. IX, and Bryobia sp. X) that have not been described previously. Bryobia sp. VIII, B. sp. IX, and B. sp. I seem to be the most abundant species present in Australian broadacre agriculture (i.e., land suitable for farms practicing large-scale crop [agriculture] operations). The AFLP data revealed that Ba. medicagoense reproduces asexually and that genetic diversity was low with only 10 genotypes found. These findings indicate a new complex of pest mites are present within Australian grain crops and pastures and this has implications for their control.},

  abstract  = {{Eriophyoidea} is a well-known mite taxon of economic importance. Due to their small size, elucidating many of
their bio-ecological aspects becomes a challenge. These mites are obligatory plant feeders, with high host
specificity and vagrant (free living) and non-vagrant (part or whole life cycle in a host) lifestyles. The mobility
(distance walked - mm, resting time - s, and number of stops) of these mites on host and non-host plant species
has been investigated. Eriophyoid species were submitted to walking tests on host and non-host plants using five
vagrant species and five non-vagrant species. The walking was recorded with video tracking (ViewPoint) for
ten minutes. Twenty replicates were performed for each treatment (eriophyoid species and plant). There was a
difference in the behavioral response of the species studied in relation to the hosts. When the species were
grouped by ecological lifestyle (vagrant and non-vagrant), non-vagrant eriophyoids presented a higher mobility
(higher distance walked, less resting time) than vagrant eriophyoids on their respective hosts. There was no
difference in the mobility of vagrant and non-vagrant species on non-host plants. The absence of a pattern of
behavioral response among the species tested here indicates that more factors are involved in the host
identification and acceptance process},
  comment   = {They tried to see some indication of host specificity by observing the walking distances of both vagrant and non-vagrant mites, hypothesizing that there would be a difference for mites which were not on their host plant. They didn't find any evidence against the null hypothesis, but did find that vagrants moved more than non-vagrants},

  abstract  = {Tetranychus urticae Koch ({Acari}: Tetranychidae) is a notorious crop pest with a worldwide distribution that has developed resistance to a wide range of Acaricides. Combined tactics of pest management have special significance not only for a reduction in pesticide residues but also to maintain the natural enemy activity, which is an objective of IPM programs. Here, we investigated the effect of low-lethal concentrations of bifenazate at LC10, LC20, and LC30 on development and reproduction parameters of Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot ({Acari}: {Phytoseiidae}). Lethal and sub-lethal concentrations were estimated using leaf dip bioassay method. The crude data were analyzed based on age-stage, two-sex life table analysis. Toxicological assays showed bifenazate treatments gradually decreased the longevity and total life span of both sexes. Our results indicated that reproductive and total fecundity of the next generation were also affected by sublethal concentrations. All concentrations caused a significant decline in oviposition days, compared to the control. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) varied from 0.1344 to 0.1151 day-1 for the mites treated with distilled water and LC30 treatments, respectively. The finite rate of increase ($\lambda$) was affected by the Acaricide concentration (lowest at LC30 concentration: 1.1221 day-1). Bifenazate concentration (LC10, LC20 and LC30) treatments gradually reduced the gross reproduction rate (GRR) and net reproductive rate (R0). Based on obtained results from current study, bifenazate is not a favorable Acaricide with A. swiriskii and cannot be recommended to use with this predatory mite in integrated management.},

In a previous study, the taxonomic status of A. tosichella in Australia was assessed using molecular markers. A. tosichella was shown to consist of two genetically distinct lineages likely to represent different species. Here we show that both lineages occupy similar distributions, occurring throughout the entire Australian wheat belt, and that the lineages are often found in sympatry. CLIMEX analysis suggests that tolerance to heat and desiccation limit the distribution of A. tosichella. In the laboratory, only one WCM lineage transmitted WSMV virus under controlled conditions. These results have implications for the management of WCM and WSMV within Australia.},

  abstract  = {The cereal rust mite Abacarus hystrix (Nalepa), a significant pest of grasses, has been regarded as one of a few exceptions among eriophyoid mites with reference to the pattern of host plant utilization. At least 60 grass species have been recorded as its hosts. Thus, the mite has long been considered as a host generalist in which host specialization would not be likely to evolve. However, recent studies have revealed that host-associated specialization is possible in A. hystrix. Here, we aimed to discriminate between the three populations of A. hystrix associated with the different hosts (namely quackgrass, ryegrass and smooth brome) on the basis of mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (D2 region of 28S rDNA) DNA sequences. The phylogenetic trees obtained with the maximum likelihood analysis of both COI and D2 region data sets showed that host-adapted strains of A. hystrix form distinct clades. Furthermore, on the COI nucleotide tree, the quackgrass- and brome-associated strains were internally divided each into two well-supported monophyletic clusters. The nucleotide D2 region data set tree showed that brome-associated strain is polyphyletic in origin. There is clear co-variation of DNA results with earlier morphological and ecological traits, as well as the results of crossing experiments. We showed that reproductively incompatible strains of A. hystrix exhibit more than 20% sequence divergence in the COI gene and 0.2% sequence divergence in the D2 28S rDNA. Our results did not confirm the placement of three host-associated strains of A. hystrix within one, ostensibly generalist, species.},

Along with descriptions of new species, some recent research has been dedicated to clarification of the status of certain taxa within the genus. Reproductive biology in {Aspidistra} as well as functional aspects of diverse flower structures remains poorly known. A. paucitepala N. Vislobokov, MS Nuraliev & DD Sokoloff is a species having flowers with low merism, a character appearing unique not only for the genus, but the entire order {asparagales}.
It has been observed that the flowers of A. phanluongii Vislobokov are visited by flies of the family Phoridae. Another species recently described from northern Vietnam, A. xuansonensis Vislobokov (Vislobokov et al., 2014) is pollinated by Cecidomyiidae flies. Ants have also been found to play a role in the reproductive cycle of {Aspidistra}.},

vegetable crops in many parts of the world. This study investigated the effects of simultaneous variations in the
local foundress population density and size on the reproduction and population growth of T. ludeni. We show
that negative population-density and -size dependency limited the reproduction of foundresses, where the
effects of population size on population growth overweighed that of population density. We further demonstrate
that ovipositing females could accelerate population growth rate (intrinsic rate of increase, rm) at higher
population sizes by producing more daughters early during their lifespan, which can be an adaptive strategy to
allow more daughters to complete development and disperse to reduce future food competition intensity. This
study provided knowledge on population dynamics in response to foundress population density and size in
general and T. ludeni population forecast and precise timing of pest management in particular.},
