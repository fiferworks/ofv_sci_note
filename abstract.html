We describe the first detection of orchid fleck virus (OFV) infecting three unreported hosts: <i>Liriope muscari</i>, cv. 'Gigantea' (Decaisne) Bailey, <i>Ophiopogon intermedius</i> Don and <i>Aspidistra elatior</i> Blume (Asparagaceae: Nolinoidaea) in Leon and Alachua Counties, FL. Orchid-infecting subgroup (Orc) of OFV infects over 50 plant species belonging to the plant families Orchidaceae, Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea), and causes citrus leprosis disease in <i>Citrus</i> (Rutaceae). The only known vectors of OFV-Orc are the flat mites, <i>Brevipalpus californicus</i> (Banks) <i>sensu lato</i> (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae). Florida has various plants in the landscape which <i>Brevipalpus</i> spp. feed on, which are susceptible to infection by OFV-Orc.

Chlorotic ringspots and flecking were seen affecting Liriopogons (<i>Liriope</i> and <i>Ophiopogon</i> spp.) in Leon County, FL. Nearby <i>A. elatior</i> also appeared chlorotic. Local diagnostics returned negative for common plant pathogens, therefore new samples were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and USDA-ARS for identification.

Two orchid-infecting strains of OFV were detected via combinations of conventional RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, Sanger sequencing and High Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Amplicons shared 98\% nucleotide identity with OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2 RNA2 genome sequences available in NCBI GenBank. Coinfections were seen in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were seen in <i>L. muscari</i> (Alachua, OFV-Orc2) and <i>A. elatior</i> (Leon, OFV-Orc1).

Three potential mite vectors were identified via cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM): <i>Brevipalpus californicus</i> (Banks) sensu lato, <i>B. obovatus</i> Donnadieu, and <i>B. confusus</i> Baker.

In conclusion, OFV orchid strains are present in northern Florida, representing a risk for susceptible plants in the southeastern US.
