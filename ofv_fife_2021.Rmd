We describe the first outbreaks of *Orchid fleck dichorhavirus*, belonging to the orchid-infecting subgroup (OFV-Orc), from three unreported hosts: *Liriope muscari*, cv. 'Gigantea (Decaisne) Bailey, *Ophiopogon intermedius* Don and *Aspidistra elatior* Blume (Asparagaceae: Nolinoidaea) in Leon and Alachua Counties, FL. Strains of OFV-Orc infect over 50 plant species belonging to the plant families Orchidaceae, Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea), and infects *Citrus* (Rutaceae) as citrus leprosis disease. The only known vectors of OFV-Orc are flat mites, genus *Brevipalpus* (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae). Florida has various plants in the landscape which *Brevipalpus* spp. feed on, which are susceptible to infection by OFV-Orc.

Chlorotic ringspots and flecking was seen affecting Liriopogons (*Liriope* spp. and *Ophiopogon* spp.) in Leon County, FL. Nearby *A. elatior* also appeared chlorotic. Local diagnostics returned negative for common plant pathogens, therefore new samples were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and USDA-ARS for identification.

Two orchid-infecting strains of Orchid fleck virus were detected via combinations of conventional RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, Sanger sequencing and High Throughput Sequencing. Amplicons shared 98% nucleotide identity with OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2 available in NCBI GenBank. Coinfections were seen in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were seen in *L. muscari* (Alachua, OFV-Orc2) and *A. elatior* (Leon, OFV-Orc1).

Three potential mite vectors were identified via cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM): *Brevipalpus californicus* (Banks) sensu lato, *B. obovatus* Donnadieu, and *B. confusus* Baker.

In conclusion, *Orchid fleck dichorhavirus* is present in northern Florida, representing a risk for susceptible plants in the southeastern US.

*Orchid fleck dichorhavirus* (OFV) is the type member for the genus *Dichorhavirus*, family *Rhabdoviridae*; a bacilliform, nuclear rhabdovirus composed of two segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA which infects plants [@Amarasinghe2019; @Dietzgen2014; @Walker2018]. Flat mites from the genus *Brevipalpus* (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae) are the only known vectors of dichorhaviruses [@Maeda1998]. *Brevipalpus californicus* (Banks) sensu lato mites are the only group known to transmit OFV in a persistent propagative manner [@Kondo2003].

OFV-infected plants exhibit various symptoms depending on the infected plant species as well as the strain of the OFV associated with the infection [@Kubo2009b], but symptoms typically appear as chlorotic flecks, which ultimately coalesce into larger spots or ringspot patterns <!--(`r citef("fig_1")`, `r citef("fig_2")`)-->.

OFV was first described as infecting *Cymbidium* orchids in Japan [@Doi1977]. OFV and OFV-like rhabdoviruses have been reported infecting orchids in Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania. The prevalence of OFV and its mite vector is thought to be associated with the movement of infected orchids [@Dietzgen2018a].

OFV naturally infects more than fifty species of Orchidaceae [@Kitajima2010; @Peng2013], some Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea) [@Mei2016; @Dietzgen2018b], and Rutaceae: (*Citrus*), where it causes citrus leprosis-like symptoms [@Cook2019; @OlmedoVelarde2019; @Roy2015; @Roy2020]. Mechanical transmission of OFV is possible to some plants belonging to the plant families Chenopodiaceae, Aizoaceae, Fabaceae, and Solanaceae [@Chang1976; @Kondo2003; @Peng2013], under laboratory conditions.

During June 2020, chlorotic ringspot symptoms were observed on Giant Lilyturf *Liriope* spp., cv. 'Gigantea' in a landscape of Leon County, Florida (`r citef("fig_1")`). *Liriope* belong to a group of plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoidaea, which includes a diverse array of various monocotyledonous southeastern Asia native liliod plants [@Chase2009; @Meng2021]. *Liriope* and the closely related *Ophiopogon* Ker Gawler (Asparagaceae: Nolinoidaea) are considered the most important ground cover nursery plants in the southeastern United States [@Mcharo2003].

Viral infections of suspected leaf samples were initially tested at the Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic at the North Florida Research and Education Center (NFREC) in Quincy, FL. All the samples were tested with RT-PCR and were found negative for begomovirus, carlavirus, potyvirus, tospovirus, and *Cucumber mosaic virus*, *Impatiens necrotic spot virus*, *Tobacco mosaic virus*, and *Tomato spotted wilt virus*.

The initial site of collection was visited two more times during 2020 to gather plants for identification of the unidentified plant pathogen. These surveys were conducted during July and August to collect more putatively infected plants, including more *Liriope* spp. as well as a new species which also belongs to the family Asparagaceae; *Aspidistra elatior* Blume, which was suspected to be infected due to unusually chlorotic leaves (`r citef("fig_2")`). Upon collection, these new samples were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) for identification. 
The FDACS determined that the virus was *Orchid fleck dichorhavirus* using previously published primers and methods [@Kubo2006a; @Kubo2006b; @Kubo2009a; @Kubo2009b; @RamosGonzalez2015]. Orchid subgroup 1, OFV-Orc was identified following the methods described in @Kondo2017.

Samples sent to the USDA confirmed the presence of OFV via one step conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR, using generic R2-Dicho-GF and R2-Dicho-GR primers, amplifying ~800 nt of L-gene (RNA2) amplicon [@Roy2020]. Sanger sequencing demonstrated a shared 98\% nucleotide identity with the orchid strain subgroup, OFV-Orc (isolates So and Br with GenBank Accession numbers: AB244418 and MK522807, respectively) [@Kondo2006; @Kondo2017]. High Throughput sequencing results confirmed the presence of OFV-Orc2 strain in the *Liriope* sample.

Subsequent surveys of plants belonging to the subfamily Nolinoidaea in Florida have revealed more sites with Asparagaceae putatively infected with OFV in Leon and Alachua counties (`r citet("tab_1")`). Mites were collected from symptomatic plants in Leon county and observed with phase contrast microscopy. Tenuipalpid mites (flat mites or false spider mites) were commonly found in abundance on the Asparagaceae, which tested positive for OFV. These flat mites were initially identified as *B. californicus* s. l. and later confirmed by the FDACS via Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy. The *B. californicus* s. l. species group, sensu @Baker1987 is suspected to contain cryptic species [@Childers2011; @Rodrigues2013], as seen in other *Brevipalpus* species, such as *B. phoenicis* (Geijskes) [@Beard2015].


<!-- You need to identify mites with special techniques [@Skoracka2015] which require supplemental techniques in addition to light microscopy for accurate identification [@Beard2015]. A plea for awareness of cryptic species [@Leon2010] -->

New mite samples were collected from the site where OFV was first confirmed and sent to USDA-ARS's Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit for analysis. Three mite species were recovered and examined under cryo scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM): *B. californicus* s.l. (`r citef("fig_3")`), *B. obovatus* Baker and *B. confusus* Donnadieu (`r citef("fig_4")`). 

The first report of OFV in the US is thought to be @Ko1985, who describes nuclear inclusions caused by an undescribed bacilliform rhabdovirus in *Brassia* orchids.  The significance of this report is their reference to spoke-wheel configurations of the viral particles [@Ko1985], a sign typically associated with OFV infection [@Chang1976]. Unfortunately, @Ko1985 made no mention of mites or further investigations of this virus. The first certain report of OFV was from Hawaii in 2001 [@Blanchfield2001], while the first report from the continental US was by @Bratsch2015. In that publication, the authors confirmed the presence of OFV in *Phalaenopsis* hybrids in the US, using TEM of ultrathin sections of plant tissue as well as molecular sequence analysis and its association with *Brevipalpus* mites [@Bratsch2015]. The authors did not make a conclusive species identification but suggested the mite vector was within the *B. californicus* group, as referred by @Kondo2003.

OFV has been reported in other Nolinoidaea in Australia [@Dietzgen2018b; @Mei2016], including *Liriope spicata* (Thunb.) Lour. [@Mei2016] but not in the US. The *Liriope* spp., cv 'Gigantea' is considered a synonym of *Liriope muscari* [@Masiero2020; @Wang2014], but some consider it a separate species: *Liriope gigantea* Hume [@Fantz2015]. We are not aware of any previous report of OFV infection in *Ophiopogon* plants. Although @Zheng2013 mention the association of *B. californicus* with *A. elatior*, but never reported OFV symptoms in this plant. However, our finding will be notified as the first report of OFV in Florida, in the US on ornamentals and among them, *A. elatior* is a new natural host of OFV.

### Conclusion
The dichorhavirus that infects citrus in Hawaii, Mexico, Colombia, and South Africa are identical to the OFV in gene order, content, and the genome sequence. According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification, OFV consist of two orchid strains (OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2) and two citrus strains (OFV-Cit1 and OFV-Cit2). Both the orchid strains of OFV infects citrus [@Roy2020], but none of the citrus strains have been reported from any orchid species. Detecting OFV in Florida represents a concern for horticulturists who grow orchids, *Liriope*, *Ophiopogon*, or other susceptible Asparagaceae species which are commonly used in landscaping. Florida is also home to a plethora of native and naturalized orchid species, many of which are threatened, including cultivating *Vanilla* in southern Florida [@Chambers2019] and the famous Ghost Orchid, [*Dendrophylax lindenii* (Lindl.) Benth. ex Rolfe]. Citrus leprosis was present in Florida during the 1860â€™s and eradicated in the mid-1960s. In fact, @Kitajima2011a found that the Citrus Leprosis virus (CiLV) which previously affected Florida citrus was a nuclear type of citrus leprosis closely related to OFV strains [@Roy2020; @Hartung2015]. Association of a distant relative of OFV named Citrus leprosis dichorhavirus-N0 (CiLV-N0) was confirmed in relation to the leprosis disease outbreak in Florida [@Hartung2015]. The recent detection of OFV-Orc1 in South Africa [@Cook2019] in *C. sinensis* (Navel and Valencia orange) and OFV-Orc2 in Hawaii [@Velarde2021] in *C. reticulata* (mandarin) and *C. jambhiri* (rough lemon) associated with leprosis-like symptoms highlights the threat of different strains of OFV on citrus; which will be a definite concern to the US multi-billion dollar citrus industry. *B. californicus*, as well as *B. yothersi* (Baker), are both known vectors of Dichorhaviruses (OFV) [@Kondo2003; @Beltran-Beltran2020] and *B. obovatus* is a suspected vector as well [@Childers2003]. All three mite species/complexes are present in Florida [@Childers2003; @Akyazi2017] (`r citef("fig_4")`). Therefore, it is critical to identify the vector of these strains of OFV in Florida to monitor their spread, and to determine the risk they represent for the native plants, agriculture and the ornamental/landscaping industries of Florida and the surrounding regions.
