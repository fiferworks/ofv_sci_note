My Comments to Authors:

Line 40 and throughout the manuscript, not needed hard returns are present and need to be removed.
Lines 49-50 Coinfections were seen in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were seen in L. muscari – Can coinfections be seen? Can single strains be seen?  No, symptoms can be and coinfections are determined by analysis.
The Spanish abstract addition is not warranted and I am confused why you added this at this late stage? The staff editors have suggested “So, my suggestion would be just to assume the other [English] abstract is ok.”.
Line 91: ‘OFV is a bacilliform’, here and throughout, while not a big issue generally it is preferred that a sentence is not started with and acronym. Consider ‘The virus is a bacilliform’
Line 94: are the only which have been- consider improving the wording
Line 96: on the infected plant, remove infected
Line 109: conditions to some plants belonging to the [plant] families, I think it is given these are plant families
Lines 135 and 146 you use ‘nucleotide identity’ then you use ‘nt’, which is not defined and there is a typo in ‘wheras’
Line 140: define “HTS”, just because I know what that is in English does not mean someone else will know what that is.
Line 149: HTS results ‘for samples obtained’ from Leon County revealed that L. muscari
Line 199: identical in gene order, content, and genome sequence – I think you mean genome sequence? I am not sure what is meant by gene order and content, it is an identical genome, correct?

Please ensure all authors have reviewed the document.

**Response to Decision Letter:**
**This third revision addresses the minor errors described in the decision letter:**

- Line 40 and throughout the manuscript, not needed hard returns are present and need to be removed. $\rightarrow$ removed hard returns

- Lines 49-50 Coinfections were seen in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were seen in L. muscari – Can coinfections be seen? Can single strains be seen?  No, symptoms can be and coinfections are determined by analysis. $\rightarrow$ changed to 'detected'

- The Spanish abstract addition is not warranted and I am confused why you added this at this late stage? The staff editors have suggested “So, my suggestion would be just to assume the other [English] abstract is ok.”.

- Line 91: ‘OFV is a bacilliform’, here and throughout, while not a big issue generally it is preferred that a sentence is not started with and acronym. Consider ‘The virus is a bacilliform’ $\rightarrow$ moved acronyms from beginnings of sentences

- Line 94: are the only which have been- consider improving the wording $\rightarrow$ changed to "Only Flat mites (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae) from the genus *Brevipalpus* are known to transmit dichorhaviruses..."

- Line 96: on the infected plant, remove infected $\rightarrow$ removed

- Line 109: conditions to some plants belonging to the [plant] families, I think it is given these are plant families $\rightarrow$ removed redundancy

- Lines 135 and 146 you use ‘nucleotide identity’ then you use ‘nt’, which is not defined and there is a typo in ‘wheras’ $\rightarrow$ clarified, 'nt' is a measurement of the amplicon $\rightarrow$ corrected to 'whereas'

- Line 140: define “HTS”, just because I know what that is in English does not mean someone else will know what that is. $\rightarrow$ changed to "High Throughput Sequencing (HTS)"

- Line 149: HTS results ‘for samples obtained’ from Leon County revealed that L. muscari $\rightarrow$ reworded

- Line 199: identical in gene order, content, and genome sequence – I think you mean genome sequence? I am not sure what is meant by gene order and content, it is an identical genome, correct? $\rightarrow$ removed repeated content

Please ensure all authors have reviewed the document.
